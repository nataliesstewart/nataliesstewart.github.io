I'm a rising senior at MIT, where I am majoring in mathematics with computer science (18C) and minoring in economics.
Generally I'm interested in category theory, algebraic topology, and similar subjects.
Most recently I've done work in knot theory.

Outside of mathematics, I tend to spend time playing jazz guitar and making electronic music.
I have a budding <a href="/blog/">blog</a> which I'm going to start using to deposit miscellaneous math thoughts.

## Current classes

I'm (probably) taking the following classes this semester:

* 18.725 (algebraic geometry 1)

* 18.919 (Kan seminar)

* 6.0002 (throwaway class taken for REST credit :/ )

* 6.849 (geometric folding algorithms)

* 21m.361 (electronic music composition)

I'll probably be taking and posting notes for 18.919 and 6.849 this semester.
To see the rest of my class history (though I'm not sure why you would), go <a href="/classes">here.</a>

## UAing

.site-main table.no-border td {
    border: none;
}

<table class="no-border" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

I'm also planning on being a UA for 18.112!
If you're a student in 112 and somehow magically stumbled on this website, feel free to email me if you need help in the class or the general perspective of an undergrad with bad opinions.
