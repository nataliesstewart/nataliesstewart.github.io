I'm a 3nd year PhD student at Harvard studying homotopy theory and algebraic topology, with particular emphasis on equivariant and algebraic considerations.
</p>
<p>
I was previously at MIT, where I studied mathematics with computer science.

I believe that the best mathematical community is one whose population is primarily selected for by interest and effort, as well as their interaction with "talent," an endogenous and perpetually evolving trait.
To this end, I care about <a href="dei.html">diversity in the mathematics community.</a>

<p>
Outside of mathematics, I tend to spend time playing jazz guitar, making electronic music, and <a href="/cooking/">cooking vegetarian food</a>.
I have a budding <a href="/blog/">blog</a> which I very occasionally use to deposit miscellaneous math thoughts.
