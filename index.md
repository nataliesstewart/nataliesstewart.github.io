I'm a rising senior at MIT, where I am majoring in mathematics with computer science (18C) and minoring in economics.
Generally I'm interested in category theory, algebraic topology, and similar subjects.
Most recently I've done work in knot theory.

Outside of mathematics, I tend to spend time playing jazz guitar and making electronic music.
I have a budding <a href="/blog/">blog</a> which I'm going to start using to deposit miscellaneous math thoughts. 
</p>

I'm (probably) taking the following classes this semester:

* 18.725 (algebraic geometry 1)

* 18.919 (Kan seminar)

* 6.0002 (throwaway class taken for REST credit :/ )

* 6.849 (geometric folding algorithms)

* 21m.361 (electronic music composition)

I'll probably be taking and posting notes for 18.919 and 6.849 this semester.
To see the rest of my class history (though I'm not sure why you would), go <a href="/classes">here.</a>
