I'm a 1st year at Harvard, where I'm persuing a PhD in topology.
Generally I'm interested in category theory, algebraic topology, and low-dimensional topology.
</p>
<p>

I was previously at MIT, where I studied mathematics with computer science (18C).

I believe that the best mathematical community is one whose population is primarily selected for by interest and effort, as well as their interaction with "talent," an endogenous and perpetually evolving trait.
To this end, I care about <a href="dei.html">diversity in the mathematics community.</a>
</p>

<p>
Outside of mathematics, I tend to spend time playing jazz guitar, making electronic music, and <a href="/cooking/">cooking vegetarian food</a>.
I have a budding <a href="/blog/">blog</a> which I very occasionally use to deposit miscellaneous math thoughts.

To see my class history at MIT (though I'm not sure why you would), go <a href="/classes">here.</a>

This semester, I'm co-running a <a href="/infty-one/">learning seminar on parts from Lurie's Higher Algebra</a>, which meets on Thursdays at 5:30 at Harvard.
