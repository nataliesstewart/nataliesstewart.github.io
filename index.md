<p>
I was an undergraduate at MIT, where I majored in math (course 18) and minored
in physics (course 8). I'm broadly interested in algebraic topology and
arithmetic geometry, but my interests are constantly changing. Outside of math,
I spend a bunch of time playing the drums, listening to instrumental prog metal,
biking, and playing basketball.

Starting August 2020, I'll be a grad student just down Mass Ave at <a
href="https://www.math.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>.

<h2> Writings </h2>
<h3>Some projects</h3>

* Stacks associated to partially ordered abelian groups (2020). To appear.<br>
Proves a generalization of Simpson's identification of filtered vector spaces
with (torsion-free) quasicoherent sheaves on $$\mathbf{A}^1/\mathbf{G}_m$$:
representations of any partially ordered abelian group in a presentable stable
infty-category $$\mathcal{C}$$ are equivalent to $$\mathcal{C}$$-valued
quasicoherent sheaves on a certain quotient stack. Also proves the existence of
an analogue of the Beilinson t-structure on filtered spectra.  Describes the
moduli problem classified by this stack, as well as (following Ogus) the
underlying space of the stack associated to a partially ordered abelian group.
Finally, fully describes the Balmer spectrum of a large class of quasi-geometric
spectral algebraic stacks in terms of the Balmer spectrum of the underlying
stack and the thick subcategories of the stable homotopy category.

* <a href="/files/thom.pdf">Higher chromatic Thom spectra via unstable homotopy
  theory (2020).</a> Last update: June 2020. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08951">arXiv</a>.<br>
Proves that a conjecture in unstable homotopy theory related to the
Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer theorem, coupled with a conjecture about the
$$\mathbf{E}_3$$-centrality of a certain element in the homotopy of Ravenel's
$$X(n)$$ spectra, leads to a construction of truncated Brown-Peterson spectra,
$$\mathrm{bo}$$, and $$\mathrm{tmf}$$ as Thom spectra (albeit not over the
sphere); this is a higher chromatic analogue of the Hopkins-Mahowald theorem
constructing $$\mathrm{H}\mathbf{F}_p$$ as a Thom spectrum. The construction of
tmf via this method is used to show that these conjectures imply that the string
orientation $$\mathrm{MString} \to \mathrm{tmf}$$ splits.
<br>
Last update: fixed some embarassing typos.

* <a href="/files/ehp.pdf">On the James and Hilton-Milnor Splittings, and the
  metastable EHP sequence (2019)</a>, joint with <a
href="http://math.mit.edu/~phaine/">Peter Haine</a>. Last update: April 2020. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04130">arXiv</a>.<br>
Studies the James and Hilton-Milnor splittings and the metastable EHP sequences
in higher category theory; this allows a generalization of the James and
Hilton-Milnor splittings to motivic spaces over any base scheme.  Two proofs of
the metastable EHP sequence are provided; one is new and non-calculational, and
(essentially) only utilizes the Blakers-Massey theorem.

* <a href="/files/witten.pdf">The Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation is surjective
  (2019).</a> Last update: January 2020. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10534">arXiv</a>.<br>
Shows that the Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation $$\mathrm{MString} \to
\mathrm{tmf}$$ is surjective on homotopy. This is done by constructing an
$$\mathbf{E}_1$$-ring $$B$$ with an $$\mathbf{E}_1$$-map $$B\to
\mathrm{MString}$$, and showing that the composite $$B \to \mathrm{MString} \to
\mathrm{tmf}$$ is surjective on homotopy. <a
href="/files/input-B-leq-24-prime-2.md">File for generating the Adams chart</a>
via Hood Chatham's <a
href="https://spectralsequences.github.io/rust_webserver/">Ext calculator</a>.

* <a href="/files/hodge.pdf">Hodge theory for elliptic curves and the Hopf
  element $$\nu$$ (2019).</a> Last update: April 2020. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02548">arXiv</a>.<br>
Shows that the sheaf on the moduli stack of elliptic curves associated to
$$\nu$$ is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of the universal elliptic curve.
Uses this to study the $$\mathbf{E}_1$$-quotient of $$\mathrm{tmf}$$ by $$\nu$$
by relating it to the moduli stack of elliptic curves with a chosen splitting of
the Hodge filtration; this results in a calculation of the resulting
descent/Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. Latest version fixes a small
calculational error (results remain unchanged).

* <a href="/files/roots-of-unity.pdf">Roots of unity in $$K(n)$$-local rings
  (2017).</a> Published in <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1090/proc/14960">Proc.
Amer. Math.  Soc</a></i>.  Last update: November 2019. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09957">arXiv</a>.<br>
Shows that for $$n>0$$, any $$K(n)$$-local $$H_\infty$$-ring $$R$$ with a
primitive $$p^k$$-th root of unity in $$\pi_0 R$$ is trivial. This implies that
the Lubin-Tate tower does not lift to a tower of derived stacks over Morava
E-theory.

* Two books on algebraic topology, notes from course taught by Haynes Miller.
  Last update: April 2018.<br>
	* <a href="/files/main1.pdf">Algebraic Topology I (2018)</a>. Published
	  <a
href="https://www.ams.org/open-math-notes/omn-view-listing?listingId=110764">online
with the AMS</a>; also available on <a
href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-905-algebraic-topology-i-fall-2016/">MIT
OpenCourseWare</a>.
	* Haynes' edits of the notes <a
	  href="http://math.mit.edu/~hrm/18.906/cumulative.pdf">Algebraic
Topology II (2018)</a>. Those notes are a cleaned up version of the
somewhat-cleaned-up version of <a href="/files/main2.pdf">my edited notes</a>.

* <a href="/files/frobenius-de-rham.pdf">The Dieudonn'e modules and Ekedahl-Oort
  types of Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves in odd characteristic (2017)</a>,
with John Halliday. Last update: December 2017. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04921">arXiv</a>.
Provides explicit formulae for the Frobenius and Verschiebung acting on the mod
p Dieudonn'e module of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, when p is an odd
prime. These formulae are used to settle some questions posed by Glass and Pries
from 2004. The code used is available at <a
href="https://github.com/sanathdevalapurkar/dieudonne-modules">this github
repository</a>.

* <a href="/files/gh.pdf">The Lubin-Tate stack and Gross-Hopkins duality
  (2017).</a> Last update: July 2018. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04806">arXiv</a>.<br>
Uses derived algebraic geometry to provide proofs and generalizations of some
duality phenomena in K(n)-local stable homotopy theory. (Fixed some typos and
technical errors, and some results on K(n)-local Spanier-Whitehead self-duality
of higher real K-theories.)

* <a href="/files/talbot-notes.pdf">Talbot proceedings: Obstruction theory for
  structured ring spectra (2017)</a>, joint with Eva Belmont et. al. Last
update: September 2017. <br>
