I'm a senior at MIT, where I am majoring in mathematics with computer science (18C) and minoring in economics.
Generally I'm interested in category theory, algebraic topology, and low-dimensional topology.

I believe that the best mathematical community is one whose population is primarily selected for by interest and effort, as well as their interaction with "talent," an endogenous and perpetually evolving trait.
To this end, I care about <a href="dei/index.md">diversity in the mathematics community.</a>

Outside of mathematics, I tend to spend time playing jazz guitar, making electronic music, and cooking vegetarian food.
I have a budding <a href="/blog/">blog</a> which I very occasionally use to deposit miscellaneous math thoughts.

## Next semester's classes

I'm (probably) taking the following classes this spring:

* 18.726 (algebraic geometry 2)

* 18.737 (linear algebraic groups)

* 6.009 (programming :/)

* 14.42 (environmental policy and economics)

To see the rest of my class history (though I'm not sure why you would), go <a href="/classes">here.</a>
