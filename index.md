I'm a rising senior at MIT, where I am majoring in mathematics with computer science (18C) and minoring in economics.
Generally I'm interested in category theory, algebraic topology, and similar subjects.
Most recently I've done work in knot theory.

Outside of mathematics, I tend to spend time playing jazz guitar and making electronic music.
I have a budding <a href="/blog/">blog</a> which I'm going to start using to deposit miscellaneous math thoughts.

<h1> Writings </h1>
<h2>Some assorted projects</h2>

* Lower bounds on volumes of hyperbolic link compliments in 3-manifolds (2020). Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. To appear.
    
  Description goes here.

* Hyperbolicity of tangles (2020). Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. To appear.
    
  Description goes here.

* Generalized augmented fully alternating links in thickened surfaces (2020). Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. To appear.
    
  Work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03026v1">Colin Adams</a> concerning hyperbolicity of generalized augmented alternating links in the 3-sphere is extended to hyperbolicity of such links in $$I$$-bundles over a surface other than the Klein bottle or $$\mathbf{RP}^2.$$
  This is used to prove hyperbolicity class of links in thickened orientable surfaces called <i> rubber band links </i>, which are generated by graphs.
  Both lower and upper bounds are provided for the volumes of rubber band links, both depending linearly on the number of edges in the graph.

* <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/spur/documents/2019Johnson-Stewart.pdf">Some graphical realizations of two-row Specht modules of Iwahori-Hecke algebras of the symmetric group (2019).</a> Joint with Miles Johnson.
    
  Studies a generalization of Khovanov's "crossingless matchings" representation of an Iwahori-Hecke Algebra of the symmetric group to include a particular number of endpoints on the "bottom" and "top";
  in the generic case, such a representation is proven to be isomorphic to a two-row Specht module whose young partition corresponds with the number of endpoints.
  Some heuristics are given towards existence of such an isomorphism in all cases.
  In the characteristic-5 case, some irreducible subrepresentation of Jordan-Shor's Fibonacci representation are given, and these are proven to be isomorphic to the irreducible quotients of two-row Specht modules whose rows differ by length at most 3.

<h2>Other things</h2>

To appear.
This is probably where Nsketches things will go.
