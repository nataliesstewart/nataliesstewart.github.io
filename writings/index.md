* Lower bounds on volumes of hyperbolic link complements in 3-manifolds (2021). Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. To appear.
    
  Lower bounds on the volumes of hyperbolic link complements are given via a new construction:
  a *bracelet link* is a link in $$S^3$$ decomposed as a cycle of interconnected tangles, and it is proved that a bracelet link of $$2n$$ tangles, such that each individual tangle may be *replicated* into a hyperbolic bracelet link of $$2n$$ copies of the tangle, is hyperbolic, with volume at least the average of the replicated links.
  
  This replication is generalized to arbitrary 3-manifolds via a construction called *starbursts*, which separate the manifold into *pieces*, which have a well defined $$2n$$-*replicant*;
  if the resulting pieces from removing a regular neighborhood of a starburst have hyperbolic replicants, then the 3-manifold is hyperbolic, with volume at least the average of the volumes of the replicants. 

  Applications are presented to hyperbolicity of links in thickened surfaces and in the solid torus.
  Will appear on Arxiv soon.

* Hyperbolicity of tangles (2021). Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. To appear.
    
  Convenient classes of tangles in cylinders and squares whose complements are $$2$$-hyperbolic or $$(2,2)$$-hyperbolic pieces are constructed.
  These are given by the appropriate analogues of prime fully-alternating links as tangles.

  Work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03026v1">Colin Adams</a> concerning hyperbolicity of generalized augmented alternating links in the 3-sphere is extended to hyperbolicity of such links in $$I$$-bundles over a surface other than the Klein bottle or $$\mathbf{RP}^2.$$
  This is used to prove hyperbolicity class of links in thickened orientable surfaces called <i> rubber band links </i>, which are generated by graphs.
  Both lower and upper bounds are provided for the volumes of rubber band links, both depending linearly on the number of edges in the graph.
  Will appear on Arxiv soon.

* <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/spur/documents/2019Johnson-Stewart.pdf">Some graphical realizations of two-row Specht modules of Iwahori-Hecke algebras of the symmetric group (2019).</a> Joint with Miles Johnson.
    
  Studies a generalization of Khovanov's "crossingless matchings" representation of an Iwahori-Hecke Algebra of the symmetric group to include a particular number of endpoints on the "bottom" and "top";
  in the generic case, such a representation is proven to be isomorphic to a two-row Specht module whose young partition corresponds with the number of endpoints.
  Some heuristics are given towards existence of such an isomorphism in all cases.
  In the characteristic-5 case, some irreducible subrepresentation of Jordan-Shor's Fibonacci representation are given, and these are proven to be isomorphic to the irreducible quotients of two-row Specht modules whose rows differ by length at most 3.
