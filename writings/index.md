<h2>Some assorted projects</h2>

* Lower bounds on volumes of hyperbolic link compliments in 3-manifolds (2020). Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. To appear.
    
  Description goes here.

* Hyperbolicity of tangles (2020). Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. To appear.
    
  Description goes here.

* Generalized augmented fully alternating links in thickened surfaces (2020). Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. To appear.
    
  Work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03026v1">Colin Adams</a> concerning hyperbolicity of generalized augmented alternating links in the 3-sphere is extended to hyperbolicity of such links in $$I$$-bundles over a surface other than the Klein bottle or $$\mathbf{RP}^2.$$
  This is used to prove hyperbolicity class of links in thickened orientable surfaces called <i> rubber band links </i>, which are generated by graphs.
  Both lower and upper bounds are provided for the volumes of rubber band links, both depending linearly on the number of edges in the graph.

* <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/spur/documents/2019Johnson-Stewart.pdf">Some graphical realizations of two-row Specht modules of Iwahori-Hecke algebras of the symmetric group (2019).</a> Joint with Miles Johnson.
    
  Studies a generalization of Khovanov's "crossingless matchings" representation of an Iwahori-Hecke Algebra of the symmetric group to include a particular number of endpoints on the "bottom" and "top";
  in the generic case, such a representation is proven to be isomorphic to a two-row Specht module whose young partition corresponds with the number of endpoints.
  Some heuristics are given towards existence of such an isomorphism in all cases.
  In the characteristic-5 case, some irreducible subrepresentation of Jordan-Shor's Fibonacci representation are given, and these are proven to be isomorphic to the irreducible quotients of two-row Specht modules whose rows differ by length at most 3.
