<summary> <label for="Lower bounds">  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06319.pdf">Lower bounds on volumes of hyperbolic link complements in 3-manifolds (2021).</a> Joint with <a href="https://sites.williams.edu/cadams/">Colin Adams</a> et al. </label> </summary>
<p>
Lower bounds on the volumes of hyperbolic link complements are given via a new construction:
  a *bracelet link* is a link in \(S^3\) decomposed as a cycle of interconnected tangles, and it is proved that a bracelet link of \(2n\) tangles, such that each individual tangle may be *replicated* into a hyperbolic bracelet link of \(2n\) copies of the tangle, is hyperbolic, with volume at least the average of the replicated links.
</p>
<p>
  This replication is generalized to arbitrary 3-manifolds via a construction called *starbursts*, which separate the manifold into *pieces*, which have a well defined \(2n\)-*replicant*;
  if the resulting pieces from removing a regular neighborhood of a starburst have hyperbolic replicants, then the 3-manifold is hyperbolic, with volume at least the average of the volumes of the replicants. 
</p>
<p>
  Applications are presented to hyperbolicity of links in thickened surfaces and in the solid torus.

    </summary> 
    Work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03026v1">Colin Adams</a> concerning hyperbolicity of generalized augmented alternating links in the 3-sphere is extended to hyperbolicity of such links in \(I\)-bundles over a surface other than the Klein bottle or \(\mathbf{RP}^2.\)
  This is used to prove hyperbolicity class of links in thickened orientable surfaces called <i> rubber band links </i>, which are generated by graphs.
  Both lower and upper bounds are provided for the volumes of rubber band links, both depending linearly on the number of edges in the graph.

## In-progress projects to look out for

<details> 
<summary>
    Additivity of the \(N_\infty\) family of \(G\)-operads.
</summary>
    I hope to define the BV tensor product and use largely categorical means to characterize the tensor products and BV-HHR norms of \(N_\infty\) operads.
</details>

<details> 
<summary>
    Additivity of the \(\mathbb{E}_V\) operads
</summary>
    I hope to leverage the closedness of the equivariant BV tensor product to reduce additivity of \(\mathbb{E}_V\) operads to checking on algebras in \(G\)-spaces, which are well-described using loop space theory.

    </summary>
  Studies a generalization of Khovanov's "crossingless matchings" representation of an Iwahori-Hecke Algebra of the symmetric group to include a particular number of endpoints on the "bottom" and "top";
  in the generic case, such a representation is proven to be isomorphic to a two-row Specht module whose young partition corresponds with the number of endpoints.
  Some heuristics are given towards existence of such an isomorphism in all cases.
  In the characteristic-5 case, some irreducible subrepresentation of Jordan-Shor's Fibonacci representation are given, and these are proven to be isomorphic to the irreducible quotients of two-row Specht modules whose rows differ by length at most 3.
