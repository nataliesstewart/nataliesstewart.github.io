Sorry for the long silence; I've been busy with midterms and studying for the
GRE. I want to talk about a question that's been on the back burner for quite a
while. There's a miraculous theorem of Hopkins and Mahowald, which states that
the free $$\E_2$$-ring with a nullhomotopy of $$p$$ is equivalent as an
$$\E_2$$-ring to $$\H\FF_p$$. More concretely, let $$S^1 \to B\GL_1(\S_p)$$
denote the map detecting $$1-p\in \pi_0(\S_p)^\times = \Z_p^\times$$. Since
$$B\GL_1(\S_p)$$ is an infinite loop space, this extends to a map $$\Omega^2
\Sigma^2 S^1 \to B\GL_1(\S_p)$$, classifying a spherical bundle $$\mu$$ over
$$\Omega^2 S^3$$. Hopkins' and Mahowald's result states that the Thom spectrum
of this spherical bundle is $$\H\FF_p$$. In light of this result, it is natural
to ask: let $$\alpha\in \pi_n(\S_p)$$. When is the free $$\E_k$$-ring with
$$\alpha = 0$$ complex oriented?

Whatever general condition we obtain should also prove that the Thom spectrum
$$(\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$ is complex oriented, so let's try to attack this case
first (without using that it is $$\H\FF_p$$). We might naively try to do this
by constructing a map $$\BU \to \Omega^2 S^3$$ of spaces over $$B\GL_1(\S_p)$$.
However, such a map cannot exist: the image of the map $$\BU \to B\GL_1(\S_p)$$
on homotopy is the (complex) image of J, so it suffices to show that there are
elements in the image of J which do not desuspend to $$S^3$$. This is indeed
true: the elements $$\alpha_{n/k}\in \pi_{2n(p-1)-1} \S_p$$ (which are defined
for $$1\leq k\leq \nu_p(n)+1$$) desuspends to $$S^{2k+1}_p$$ with Hopf
invariant $$\alpha_{n-k}$$. To be concrete, $$\alpha_{p^2/p}\in
\pi_{2p^2(p-1)-1} \S_p$$ does not desuspend to $$S^3$$.

Nonetheless, we can define a *$$T(1)$$-orientation* of $$(\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$.
Recall that $$T(1)$$ is the free $$\E_1$$-ring with $$\alpha_1 = 0$$, i.e., the
Thom spectrum of the map $$\Omega S^{2p-1} \to B\GL_1(\S_p)$$ classifying
$$\alpha_1$$. There is a map $$\Omega S^{2p-1} \to \Omega^2 S^3$$ of spaces
over $$B\GL_1(\S_p)$$ detecting $$\alpha_1$$ in $$\pi_{2p}(S^3)$$, and this
defines a map $$T(1) \to (\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$ of Thom spectra. This detects the
fact that $$\alpha_1$$ is null in $$(\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$. In fact, this implies
that $$\alpha_n$$ is null in $$(\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$ for all $$n$$.

Instead of trying to define a ring map $$\MU \to (\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$ of *Thom
spectra*, let us try to directly define a complex orientation of $$(\Omega^2
S^3)^\mu$$ (the *integral* Thom spectrum, which *a posteriori* we know is
$$\H\FF_2$$), i.e., a factorization $$\S \to \Sigma^{-2} \CP^\infty \to
(\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$ of the unit. An old theorem of Atiyah's says that if
$$\CP^\infty \to \BU$$ is the map classifying the virtual vector bundle $$\xi =
\mathcal{L} - 1$$, where $$\mathcal{L}$$ is the canonical line bundle on
$$\CP^\infty$$, then the Thom spectrum $$(\CP^\infty)^\xi$$ is equivalent to
$$\Sigma^{-2} \CP^\infty$$. The composite $$\CP^\infty \to \BU \to B\GL_1(\S)$$
detects the spherical fibration over $$\CP^\infty$$ defined by the one-point
compactification of $$\xi$$ (viewed as a virtual vector bundle), and upon
looping this composite, the map $$S^1 = \Omega \CP^\infty \to \GL_1(\S)$$
detects $$\eta\in \pi_1(\S)$$. 

We would therefore like to define a pointed map $$BS^1 = \CP^\infty \to
\Omega^2 S^3$$ of pointed spaces over $$B\GL_1(\S)$$. However, there cannot be
any such map: it would be adjoint to a map $$\Sigma^2 \CP^\infty \to S^3$$
which is $$\eta$$ on the bottom cell of $$\Sigma^2 \CP^\infty$$. In particular,
the map $$\eta:S^4 \to S^3$$ would factor as $$S^4 \to \Sigma^2 \CP^2 =
\Sigma^4 C\eta\to S^3$$. This is absurd: $$\eta^2$$ is not zero! 

Let me end with a few remarks. At the prime $$2$$, the spectrum $$T(1)$$ is
simply $$X(2)$$, so we can now ask about extending this map $$X(2) \to
(\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$ to a map $$X(3) \to (\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$. To answer this,
we need to understand how $$X(n)$$ is created from $$X(n-1)$$. In [this
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03042.pdf), Beardsley shows that there is an
element $$\chi_n \in \pi_{2n-1}(X(n)_p)$$ such that $$X(n+1)_p$$ is the
$$\E_1$$-quotient of $$X(n)_p$$ by $$\chi_n$$. Let us recall how this element
is constructed. There is a fiber sequence $$\Omega \SU(n) \to \Omega \SU(n+1)
\to \Omega S^{2n+1}$$. By construction, the composite $$\Omega \SU(n) \to
\Omega \SU(n+1) \to B\GL_1(\S_p) \to B\GL_1(X(n)_p)$$ is null, and hence
factors through the cofiber $$C$$ of $$\Omega \SU(n) \to \Omega \SU(n+1)$$.
There is a map $$\Omega S^{2n+1} \to C$$ (which won't be an equivalence), and
so we obtain a map $$\Omega S^{2n+1} \to B\GL_1(X(n)_p)$$. This defines the
element $$\chi_n \in \pi_{2n-1}(X(n)_p)$$.  In fact, $$\chi_n$$ vanishes for
$$n+1$$ not a power of $$p$$. In the case that $$n+1 = p^m$$, the map
$$\chi_{p^m-1}: S^{2p^m-3} = S^{|v_m|-1} \to X(p^m-1)_p$$, which I'll denote by
$$\sigma_m$$, factors through the inclusion $$T(m-1)_p\to X(p^m-1)_p$$. For
instance, $$\sigma_1 = \alpha_1\in \pi_{2p-3}(\S) \subseteq
\pi_{2p-3}(X(p-1))$$. These elements probably have to do with something
*awesome*, relating $$T(m-1)$$ to $$\BP{m}$$. Unfortunately, I don't understand
these elements very well yet, so I won't say anything more about them.

Let me close by mentioning that there is yet *another* approach to
understanding complex orientations, due to [Hopkins and
Lawson](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00047.pdf). I'll return back to this post at
some point to write down my understanding of what's going on in their paper.
