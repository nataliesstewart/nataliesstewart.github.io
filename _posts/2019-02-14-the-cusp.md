Let $$\hat{\GG}_a$$ denote the additive formal group over $$\FF_2$$, so that
$$\hat{\GG}_a = \spf \FF_2[\![x]\!]$$. The coproduct sends $$x$$ to $$x\otimes
1 + 1\otimes x$$. Let us attempt to understand automorphisms of
$$\hat{\GG}_a$$: this is the data of an $$f(t) = a_0 + a_1 t + \cdots$$ such
that $$f(t+t') = f(t)+f(t')$$. Since we're in characteristic $$2$$, this forces
$$f(t) = \sum_{i\geq 0} a_{2^i} x^{2^i}$$; in particular, the space of such
power series is given by $$\cA_\ast = \spec \FF_2[\xi_1, \xi_2, \cdots]$$
(where $$\xi_k = a^{2^k}$$). The automorphism group is also a group, under
composition, and we can use this to work out the coproduct on $$\FF_2[\xi_1,
\xi_2, \cdots]$$. Suppose $$g(t) = \sum_{i\geq 0} \xi_i' x^{2^i}$$ is another
such automorphism; then

$$f(g(t)) = \sum_{i\geq 0} \xi_i \left(\sum_{j\geq 0} {\xi_j'}^{2^i}
x^{2^{i+j}}\right) = \sum_n \left(\sum_{0\leq i\leq n} \xi_{n-i}
{\xi_i'}^{2^{n-i}}\right) x^n.$$

It follows that the coproduct sends $$\xi_n$$ to $$\sum_{0\leq i\leq n}
\xi_{n-i} {\xi_i'}^{2^{n-i}}$$. This is precisely the characterization of the
Steenrod algebra, so we conclude that the automorphism group of the additive
formal group over $$\FF_2$$ is represented by $$\spec$$ of the dual Steenrod
algebra. In particular, quasicoherent sheaves over $$B\Aut(\hat{\GG}_a)$$ are
the same as Steenrod comodules, i.e., $$\FF_2$$-vector spaces along with an
action of $$\Aut(\hat{\GG}_a)$$. If $$\hat{\GG}$$ denotes the universal formal
group over $$B\Aut(\hat{\GG}_a)$$ (which is exactly the additive formal group
over $$\FF_2$$ along with the action of its automorphism group), then the above
formulae make it clear that $$\hat{\GG}$$ is precisely the cohomology ring
$$\H^\ast(\mathbf{C}P^\infty;\FF_2)$$ along with its Steenrod action.

We know that there are interesting quotient Hopf algebras of the dual Steenrod
algebra, so it is natural to ask if this is somehow reflected in algebraic
geometry.

Let $$\Mqd$$ denote the moduli stack of possibly singular quadratic curves,
defined by equations $$y = x^2+bx+c$$ modulo translations $$x\mapsto x+r$$.
Suppose that the quadratic curve $$C$$ parametrized by this equation is smooth,
so $$\Delta = b^2-4c$$ is a unit. Let $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ be roots of
$$x^2+bx+c$$; then, there is a unique group structure on
$$\mathbf{P}^1\setminus\{\alpha,\beta\}$$ with $$\infty$$ as the unit, which
sends $$(x_1,x_2)$$ to $$(x_1x_2-c)/(x_1+x_2-b)$$. This makes
$$\mathbf{P}^1\setminus\{\alpha,\beta\}$$ isomorphic to the multiplicative
group. If $$\Delta$$ is not a unit (i.e., $$C$$ is singular), then the curve
has additive degeneration, and we find that there's a map $$\Mqd \to \Mfg$$.
(In fact, $$\Mqd$$ is the stack associated to the *connective* spectrum $$ko$$
(in the sense of [this document](http://www.mit.edu/~sanathd/wood.pdf)).) This
morphism is representable.

In particular, if $$C$$ denotes the projectivization of the singular quadratic
$$y = x^2$$ over $$\FF_2$$, then there is a closed immersion $$\Aut(C)
\hookrightarrow \Aut(\hat{\GG}_a) = \spec \cA_\ast$$. The group scheme
$$\Aut(C)$$ is affine, and so if we write $$\Aut(C) = \spec B$$, then $$B$$ is
a quotient Hopf algebra of $$\cA_\ast$$. The most natural candidate (given that
this is motivated by $$ko$$) is $$A(1)_\ast = \FF_2[\zeta_1, \zeta_2,
\cdots]/(\zeta_1^4,\zeta_2^2,\zeta_3,\cdots)$$ --- but this is false! So: can
we see this algebro-geometrically? (Note that $$\spec A(1)_\ast \in
\mathrm{Ext}^1(\alpha_4, \alpha_2)$$.) Since everything is so explicit, and
$$C$$ is so simple, this is easy:

$$\zeta_1\cdot(x,y) = (x+\zeta_1, y+\zeta_1^2), \ \zeta_2\cdot(x,y) =
(x+\zeta_2, y).$$

These are automorphisms of the affine algebraic curve $$y = x^2$$, but only the
latter automorphism extends to one of the projectivization. And indeed,
$$B\cong \FF_2[t]/t^2$$. Suppose that $$q:\spec \FF_2\to \Mqd$$ classifies this
singular quadratic curve (where now $$\Mqd$$ denotes the moduli of quadratic
curves over $$2$$-local rings); then, $$\spec \FF_2\times_{\Mqd} \spec
\FF_2\cong \Aut(C) \cong \spec B$$. Since $$\spec \FF_2$$ is the stack
associated to the Eilenberg-Maclane spectrum $$\H\FF_2$$, so we might expect
that $$\spec \FF_2\times_{\Mqd} \spec \FF_2$$ is the stack (over $$\spec
\FF_2$$) associated to the $$\H\FF_2$$-algebra $$\H\FF_2\wedge_{ko} \H\FF_2$$.
This stack is affine, and is given by $$\Aut(C)$$; in particular, if $$\spec
\FF_2\times_{\Mqd} \spec \FF_2$$ is the stack (scheme) associated to
$$\H\FF_2\wedge_{ko} \H\FF_2$$, we would find that
$$\pi_\ast(\H\FF_2\wedge_{ko} \H\FF_2) \cong B$$; but this is false, since
$$\pi_\ast(\H\FF_2\wedge_{ko} \H\FF_2) \cong A(1)_\ast$$. (This final claim is
equivalent to the statement that $$\pi_\ast(\H\FF_2\wedge ko) \cong
A_\ast/\!\!/A(1)_\ast$$.) It is interesting, though, that $$\spec A(1)_\ast$$
sits inside the automorphism group scheme of the *affine* cuspidal quadratic.

We note the following interesting result, due to Bhattacharya, Egger, and
Mahowald: there is a type $$2$$ spectrum $$A_1$$ such that $$ko \wedge A_1
\simeq \H\FF_2$$; in other words, $$\H_\ast(A_1) \cong A(1)_\ast$$ as comodules
over the dual Steenrod algebra.  This amounts to the statement that there is a
coherent sheaf $$\cf(A_1)$$ over $$\Mfg$$ supported away from $$\Mfg^{\leq 1}$$
(which is where the smooth locus $$B\Z/2$$ of $$\Mqd$$ lands under the morphism
$$f:\Mqd\to \Mfg$$) such that $$f^\ast \cf(A_1) \cong q_\ast \co_{\FF_2}$$.

We can attempt to run the same exercise for the moduli $$\Mcub$$ of *cubic*
curves. In this case, it is [known](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6100.pdf) that
$$\Mcub$$ is the stack associated to $$\tmf$$. At the prime $$2$$, we know that
$$\pi_\ast(\H\FF_2\wedge_{\tmf} \H\FF_2) \cong A(2)_\ast =
\FF_2[\zeta_1,\zeta_2,\cdots]/(\zeta_1^8,\zeta_2^4,\zeta_3^2,\zeta_4,\cdots)$$
(which is equivalent to the statement that $$\H_\ast(\tmf) \cong
A_\ast/\!\!/A(2)_\ast$$). Now, if $$C$$ denotes the projectivization of the
singular curve $$y^2 = x^3$$ over $$\FF_2$$, then $$\Aut(C)\cong \spec
A(1)_\ast$$ (as is worked out in Lemma 3.5
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6100.pdf)). And just as before, we can write
down formulae which exhibit $$\spec A(2)_\ast$$ as sitting inside the
automorphism group scheme of the affine cuspidal cubic. Here are some formulae
that I worked out:

$$\zeta_1\cdot(x,y) = (x+\zeta_1^2x^2, y+\zeta_1^2 xy+\zeta_1 x^2+\zeta_1^3
y^2), \ \zeta_2\cdot(x,y) = (x+\zeta_2^2,y+\zeta_2 x), \ \zeta_3\cdot(x,y) =
(x,y+\zeta_3).$$

I used Sage to check that the formula for $$\zeta_1$$ is actually of degree
$$8$$, and indeed it is. I don't know whether one could use this to somehow
prove something about $$\pi_\ast(\H\FF_2\wedge_{\tmf} \H\FF_2)$$.

At the prime $$3$$, [something weird
happens](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mikehill/Research/HilltmfBSigma3.pdf):
there is an isomorphism $$\pi_\ast(\H\FF_3\wedge_{\tmf} \H\FF_3) \cong
A(1)_\ast \otimes E(a_2)$$, where $$A(1)_\ast = \FF_3[\zeta_1]/\zeta_1^3\otimes
E(\tau_0,\tau_1)$$ is dual to the subalgebra of $$A_\ast$$ generated by
$$\beta$$ and $$P^1$$, and $$a_2$$ is a degree $$9$$ element with

$$\Delta(a_2) = 1\otimes a_2 + \zeta_1\otimes \tau_1 - \zeta_1^2\otimes \tau_0
+ a_2\otimes 1.$$

I don't know where this comes from, because I haven't worked out the
automorphisms of the cuspidal cubic over $$\FF_3$$, but I expect that this
mysterious element $$a_2$$ will be found in its automorphism group.

In any case, this raises a few interesting questions. One important question
which comes up often is how one can take connective covers of periodic
$$\E_\infty$$-rings. Namely, suppose $$A$$ is an $$\E_\infty$$-ring arising as
the global sections of an even-periodic refinement $$\dX$$ of a flat and affine
map $$X\to \Mfg$$ from a Noetherian and separated Deligne-Mumford stack, so
that $$A$$ is periodic with some even period. (The periodicity claim is not too
hard to prove; here's a sketch. There is some periodicity generator $$u$$ in
$$\H^0(X; \pi_2 \co_\dX)$$, and we would like to prove that some power of $$u$$
survives the descent spectral sequence. Since the map $$X\to \Mfg$$ is affine,
and $$(\Mfg)_\mathbf{Q} = B\GG_m$$, we conclude that $$X_\mathbf{Q}$$ is an
affine scheme; in particular, the $$E_2$$-page (and hence all pages) of the
spectral sequence is torsion, so by the Leibniz rule, for each $$r\geq 2$$,
there is some $$N_r$$ such that $$d_r(u^{N_r}) = 0$$. Now, the descent spectral
sequence agrees with the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for $$A$$, e.g., by
Theorem 4 of [this document](http://www.mit.edu/~sanathd/wood.pdf), so since
$$A$$ is $$L_n$$-local for some $$n$$ by Noetherianness of $$X$$, we conclude
that the descent spectral sequence generates at some finite page $$r'$$; in
this case, $$u^{N_{r'}}$$ survives the descent spectral sequence, and is
therefore a periodicity generator for $$A$$.) An example of such an $$A$$ is
$$\TMF$$. However, taking the connective cover of $$\TMF$$ is a bad idea: the
$$L_2$$-localization of $$\tau_{\geq 0} \TMF$$ will not be equivalent to
$$\TMF$$! Instead, one extends the moduli problem to the cusp, and this gives
the non-periodic $$\E_\infty$$-ring $$\Tmf$$. The "junk" which is
Grothendieck-Serre-Anderson dual to the positive degree elements is
concentrated entirely in negative degrees, so one isn't left with any
negative-dimensional "ghosts" if we take the connective cover; and indeed, by
defining $$\tmf = \tau_{\geq 0} \Tmf$$, one obtains a very nice connective
$$\E_\infty$$-spectrum.

The same story could, of course, be told for $$\KO$$, but it's not nearly as
interesting because one doesn't have to extend over the cusp. In both cases,
though, we find that if $$A$$ (which could now denote $$\KO$$ or $$\Tmf$$) has
[some kind of Serre
duality](http://www.mit.edu/~sanathd/gh.pdf#page=9&zoom=100,0,569), then taking
the connective cover of $$A$$ will yield a well-behaved spectrum if the product
of negative-dimensional elements of $$\pi_\ast A$$ with positive-dimensional
elements *never* yields a nontrivial element of nonnegative dimension (not true
for $$\KO$$ but true for $$\Tmf$$). On the level of algebra, the stack
associated to $$\tau_{\geq 0} A$$ would be some extension of the moduli problem
associated to $$X$$ that takes additive degeneration into account (somewhat
more precisely, this stack would add a point $$C$$ to $$X$$ which is in the
closure of any point in $$X$$). It's kinda impossible to devise a general
procedure to do so for a general algebraically defined stack $$X$$, and this
corresponds topologically to the fact that it's hard to take connective covers
of $$L_n$$-local $$\E_\infty$$-rings "in the right way".  If this is possible
for $$A$$, though, then the above discussion shows that it is reasonable (and I
apologize for getting philosophical) to try to understand $$\spec
\pi_\ast(\H\FF_2\wedge_{\tau_{\geq 0} A} \H\FF_2)$$ (which is equivalent to
understanding $$\H_\ast(\tau_{\geq 0} A)$$) by studying automorphisms of $$C$$.
