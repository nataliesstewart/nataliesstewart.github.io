Let's go back to working through our
[program](/algebraic-topology/2019/04/01/mrs.html) of trying to
[construct](/algebraic-topology/2019/04/18/cmn.html) $$\BP{n-1}$$ as a Thom
spectrum, namely as the Thom spectrum of a map $$\Omega^2 S^{2p^n+1} \to
B\GL_1(T(n))$$ which detects an indecomposable on the bottom cell of the source.
The method of proof is to define a map $$\Omega T^{2p^n+1}(p) \to
B\GL_1(T(n-1))$$ whose Thom spectrum is also $$\BP{n-1}$$, and $$\Omega
T^{2p^n+1}(p)$$ is the Anick space. We'd like to think of this as saying that
$$\BP{n-1}$$ is the twisted smash product $$T(n-1) \twsm \Omega
T^{2p^n+1}(p)_+$$. There is a slight issue at $$p=2$$; if I understand
correctly, it is [not
possible](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.156.8050&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
for the delooping $$T^{2p^n+1}(p)$$ to exist. For the purpose of this post,
let's pretend as though this is not the case (at least for $$n=2,3$$), i.e.,
that there exists a space $$\Omega T^{2^{n+1}+1}(2)$$ sitting in a fiber
sequence

$$\Omega S^{2^{n+1}-1} \to \Omega T^{2^{n+1}+1}(2) \to \Omega^2 S^{2^{n+1}+1}.$$

In the chromatic world, there are interesting spectra which are "smaller" than
$$\BP{n}$$ and detect spherical elements. For instance, when $$n=p-1$$, this is
the spectrum $$\mathrm{eo}_{p-1}$$, which is conjectural for $$p>3$$. At the
prime $$2$$, there are equivalences $$\ko \wedge C\eta \simeq \ku = \BP{1}$$ and
$$\tmf\wedge DA_1 \simeq \tmf_1(3) = \BP{2}$$. We studied the undoubled version
of $$DA_1$$ in [this post](/algebraic-topology/2019/03/26/thom-spectra.html),
where we showed (modulo calculation errors) that it's not a Thom spectrum.

In light of the equivalence $$T(n-1) \twsm \Omega T^{2p^n+1}(p)_+ \simeq
\BP{n-1}$$, it is natural to wonder if there are ($$\E_1$$-)ring spectra $$A$$
and $$B$$ such that $$A \twsm \Omega T^{2p+1}(p)_+ \simeq \ko$$ and $$A \wedge
C\eta \simeq T(1)$$, and $$B \twsm \Omega T^{2p^2+1}(p)_+ \simeq \tmf$$ and $$B
\wedge DA_1 \simeq T(2)$$. (Again, $$E \twsm X_+$$ means taking the Thom
spectrum of a particular map $$X \to B\GL_1(E)$$.) Let us focus on $$\ko$$ for
now, and explore the consequences of having such a spectrum.

In this case, there is an equivalence between $$T(1)$$ and the free
$$\E_1$$-algebra $$\S /\!\!/ \eta$$, given by the *$$\E_1$$-quotient* of the
sphere by $$\eta$$. OK, so $$A$$ must satisfy the relation $$A\wedge C\eta
\simeq \S /\!\!/\eta$$. Since $$\S /\!\!/ \eta = \S \twsm \Omega S^3_+$$ and
$$C\eta = (S^2)^\mu$$, we take motivation from the EHP sequence

$$S^2 \to \Omega S^3 \to \Omega S^5,$$

and define $$A$$ to be the $$\E_1$$-quotient $$\S/\!\!/\nu$$. It is not hard to
see that $$\nu=0$$ in $$\pi_\ast \S/\!\!/\eta$$ (there is a $$\Sq^4$$ emanating
from the bottom cell of $$\S/\!\!/\eta$$), so by the universal property of
$$\E_1$$-quotients, we obtain a map $$\S/\!\!/\nu \to \S/\!\!/\eta$$. Including
into $$\S/\!\!/\eta$$ as its bottom skeleton is $$C\eta$$, so using the
($$\E_2$$-)ring structure on $$\S/\!\!/\eta$$, we obtain a map $$\S/\!\!/\nu
\wedge C\eta \to \S/\!\!/\eta$$. It is not hard to see that this map is an
isomorphism on mod $$2$$ homology, so it is itself an equivalence (after
$$2$$-completion, but that's what we were implicitly doing anyway). This is also
proved in Section 2.5 of [this
paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1251/f080634161a5f82798b3213db606bee6051d.pdf),
but I didn't find out about this reference until after I finished this post.

Where do we get the equivalence $$A \twsm \Omega T^{2p+1}(p)_+ \simeq \ko$$
from? I've got no idea (I don't even know how to do the easier case of $$\ku$$,
where $$A$$ is replaced with $$\S/\!\!/\eta$$, and we have an
$$\E_2$$-structure), but here is a small piece of evidence. The map $$\Omega
T^{2p+1}(p) \to B\GL_1(T(1))$$ is supposed to extend the map $$S^6\to
B\GL_1(T(1))$$ detecting the element $$\sigma_1\in \pi_5 T(1)$$ whose
$$\E_1$$-quotient gets you $$T(2)$$. At the very least, then, we should be able
to find $$\sigma_1$$ in $$A = \S/\!\!/\nu$$. But what is $$\sigma_1$$? The
bottom few cells of $$T(1)$$ are given by $$C\eta \wedge C\nu$$, and
$$\sigma_1$$ is the element detected on the $$4$$-cell (attached to the
$$0$$-cell by $$\nu$$) lifting $$\eta$$ via the identity $$\eta\nu = 0$$. In
other words, $$\sigma_1$$ is already detected in $$\pi_5 C\nu$$; it is the Toda
bracket $$\langle \eta,\nu,1_{\S/\!\!/\nu}\rangle$$ in $$\S/\!\!/\nu$$. So there
may be hope for the existence of a map $$\Omega T^{2p+1}(p) \to
B\GL_1(\S/\!\!/\nu)$$ whose Thom spectrum is $$\ko$$.

Other than just being conceptually awesome, what's the point of this result?
First, notice that the map $$\S/\!\!/\nu\to \ko$$ is a surjection on homotopy
(and that the above result is a spectrification of this statement). We can
construct explicit representatives of some of the low-dimensional elements of
$$\ko$$ (and then get the other elements in $$\pi_\ast \ko$$ through
multiplication): it is clear that $$\eta$$ and $$\eta^2$$ come from
$$\S/\!\!/\nu$$. For the generator $$\alpha$$ of $$\pi_4 \ko$$, we notice that
the Toda bracket $$\langle 8,\nu, 1_{\ko}\rangle$$ contains $$\alpha$$ and makes
sense in $$\S/\!\!/\nu$$. For the generator $$\beta$$ of $$\pi_8 \ko$$, we
notice that the Toda bracket $$\langle 8, \nu, \alpha\rangle$$ contains
$$\beta$$ and makes sense in $$\S/\!\!/\nu$$. (The indeterminacy is $$0\mod 2$$
for each bracket.)

Next, consider the map $$S^4\to \BSpin$$; upon composition with the
J-homomorphism, this is sent to the Hopf element $$\nu$$. In particular, taking
Thom spectra, we find that $$\nu$$ vanishes in $$\MSpin$$. Since $$\MSpin$$ is
an $$\E_\infty$$-ring, we obtain a map $$\S/\!\!/\nu\to \MSpin$$ factoring the
unit. In particular, composing with the Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro orientation, we
obtain $$\E_1$$-ring maps $$\S/\!\!/\nu\to \MSpin\to \ko$$. Since we showed that
the composite is surjective on homotopy, we conclude that the
Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro orientation $$\MSpin\to \ko$$ is also surjective on
homotopy. Now, we already knew this, of course; in fact, [Anderson, Brown, and
Peterson](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970690) proved something stronger: they
showed that $$\ko$$ splits (as a spectrum) off $$\MSpin$$.

This is interesting, because it provides us with a template of what happens for
$$\tmf$$. It's not known, I think, whether $$\tmf$$ splits off of $$\MString$$,
but in his [ICM address](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0212397.pdf), Mike stated
that the Witten genus $$\MString \to \tmf$$ is surjective on homotopy.
Unfortunately, no reference was provided --- so we're going to try to prove this
ourselves! Given the discussion above, we have a template of a proof: construct
this spectrum $$B$$ as an $$\E_1$$-ring with some universal property, use this
universal property to factor the unit of $$\MString$$ through $$B$$, and finally
show that the map $$B\to \tmf$$ is surjective on homotopy.

Let's try to understand $$B$$. We know that $$B\wedge DA_1\simeq T(2)$$, and
since $$\H_\ast T(2) \cong \FF_2[\xi_1^2, \xi_2^2]$$ and (additively) $$\H_\ast
DA_1 \cong \FF_2[\xi_2^2,\xi_2^2]/(\xi_1^8,\xi_2^4)$$, we expect that $$\H_\ast
B\cong \FF_2[\xi_1^8, \xi_2^4]$$. Since the homology of the $$\E_1$$-quotient
$$\S/\!\!/\sigma$$ is $$\FF_2[\xi_1^8]$$ and $$|\xi_2^4| = 12$$, we expect $$B$$
to be the Thom spectrum of a map $$\Omega S^{13} \to B\GL_1(\S/\!\!/\sigma)$$.
The bottom cell of $$\Omega S^{13}$$ should detect the lift of $$\nu$$ (or
$$2\nu$$?) to $$\S/\!\!/\sigma$$ coming from the relation $$\sigma\nu = 0$$.

We now use our favorite trick: noticing that $$\S/\!\!/\sigma$$ is the Thom
spectrum of a map $$\Omega S^9 \to B\GL_1(\S)$$, we find that in order to
construct $$B$$, it suffices to construct an $$\E_1$$-space $$Z$$ sitting in a
fiber sequence

$$\Omega S^9 \to Z \to \Omega S^{13},$$

and a map $$Z\to B\GL_1(\S)$$ detecting $$\sigma$$ on $$\pi_8$$. Since $$Z$$ is
to be an $$\E_1$$-space, we need to equivalently construct a space $$\B Z$$ such
that there is a fiber sequence

$$S^9 \to \B Z \to S^{13}.$$

In order to construct such a fiber sequence, we first note that there is a fiber
sequence

$$S^9 \to \BO(9) \to \BO(10),$$

and so we just need to define a nice map $$S^{13} \to \BO(10)$$, i.e., an
element of $$\pi_{12} \mathrm{O}(10)$$. Then $$\B Z$$ is the pullback $$S^{13}
\times_{\BO(10)} \BO(9)$$. According to [this
table](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/orthogonal+group#HomotopyGroups),
$$\pi_{12} \mathrm{O}(10) \cong \Z/12$$ (and under the boundary map of the fiber
sequence above, this maps to the element $$2\nu\in \pi_{12} S^9$$), so we choose
a generator of this group to obtain our desired fiber sequence defining $$\B
Z$$. It is easy to see that there is a map $$Z\to \BO$$ (which in fact lifts to
$$\BString$$), and we define $$B$$ to be the Thom spectrum of this bundle.
Moreover, using the fiber sequence involving $$B$$, we find that $$\H_\ast B
\cong \FF_2[\xi_1^8, \xi_2^4]$$, as desired.

To get an equivalence $$B\wedge DA_1\simeq T(2)$$, it suffices to define a map
$$B\to T(2)$$; since there is a map $$DA_1\to T(2)$$, the multiplication on
$$T(2)$$ defines a map $$B\wedge DA_1\to T(2)$$, which is an equivalence on mod
$$2$$ homology. Here's a physics-level-of-rigor argument for the existence of a
map $$B\to T(2)$$. The $$12$$-skeleton of $$T(2)$$ is given by $$S^0 \cup_\sigma
e^8 \cup_{2\nu} e^{12}$$, so $$\sigma$$ vanishes in $$T(2)$$. This defines an
$$\E_1$$-ring map $$\S/\!\!/\sigma\to T(2)$$. Since $$B$$ is supposed to be the
$$\E_1$$-quotient of $$\S/\!\!/\sigma$$ (this is where we lose our claim to
rigor) by the element in $$\pi_{11}$$, it suffices to show that the
corresponding element vanishes in $$T(2)$$; but this again follows from the
structure of its $$12$$-skeleton.

Next, we need to show that there is an equivalence $$B \twsm \Omega
T^{2p^2+1}(p) \simeq \tmf$$, i.e., that there is a map $$\Omega T^{2p^2+1}(p)
\to B\GL_1(B)$$ whose Thom spectrum is $$\tmf$$. Again, I don't know how to
define such a map since I already can't yet do this if $$B$$ is replaced by
$$T(2)$$, but we can at least try to show that $$\sigma_2\in \pi_{13} T(2)$$
comes from $$B$$. The $$12$$-skeleton of $$B$$ is $$S^0 \cup_\sigma e^8
\cup_{2\nu} e^{12}$$, and I think that $$\sigma_2$$ is the lift of $$4\in \pi_0
\S$$ to this finite complex.

Anyway, let's return to our study of the Witten genus. The map $$Z\to \BO$$
which Thomifies to $$B$$ in fact lifts through $$\BString$$, and we obtain
$$\E_1$$-ring maps $$B\to \MString\to \tmf$$, where the final map is the Witten
genus. As with $$\ko$$, to prove surjectivity of the Witten genus, it suffices
to show that the map $$B\to \tmf$$ is surjective on homotopy. Since $$\pi_\ast
\tmf$$ (at $$p=2$$) has indecomposable generators in degrees $$\leq 24$$ (see
[here](https://www3.nd.edu/~mbehren1/papers/handbook.pdf)), it suffices to
calculate $$\pi_\ast B$$ up through dimension $$24$$ and observe that it hits
all the indecomposable generators of $$\pi_\ast \tmf$$. (OK, this isn't exactly
right. But I still believe that it is sufficient to look up through dimension
$$24$$; I'll try to figure out a proof.) We do this the "old-fashioned" way:
look at the Adams spectral sequence! (After all, we know the $$A_\ast$$-comodule
structure on $$\H_\ast(B)$$.) Here is a picture of the $$E_2$$-page of the Adams
spectral sequence (using Bruner's ext program) with some differentials shown for
$$B$$ up through dimension $$28$$ (click for a pdf):

<a href="/assets/B.pdf"><img style="display: block; margin: auto;" height="175%"
width="175%" alt="photo" src="/assets/B.png"></a>

And here is a picture of the $$E_2$$-page of the Adams spectral sequence with
differentials drawn in for $$\tmf$$ up through dimension $$28$$ (click for a
pdf):

<a href="/assets/tmf.pdf"><img style="display: block; margin: auto;"
height="175%" width="175%" alt="photo" src="/assets/tmf.png"></a>

This obviously isn't a proof, but the classes in red, blue, and green survive to
the $$E_\infty$$-page of the Adams spectral sequence in both charts (and map to
each other). The red class in the chart for $$\tmf$$ corresponds to the
generator in degree $$8$$, the blue class corresponds to the generator in degree
$$12$$, and the green class corresponds to the generator in degree $$24$$.
(**Edit:** this isn't right! I'll fix this at some point.) Hopefully I can flesh
this out. (Note, of course, that one doesn't need to work with $$B$$ to show
surjectivity of the Witten genus; the interesting part is that $$B$$ is a Thom
spectrum with smaller homology than $$\MString$$ which surjects onto $$\tmf$$.
Of course, the advantage of using $$\MString$$ is that we know $$\pi_\ast
\BString$$, but we don't know $$\pi_\ast Z$$.)

This raises the question: how can we explicitly construct a $$24$$-dimensional
String-manifold $$M$$ (so $$[M]\in \pi_{24} \MString$$) mapping to the element
$$8\Delta\in \pi_{24} \tmf^\wedge_2$$? We "know" (scare quotes because of the
lack of details in the above discussion) it exists.
