In this post (and presumably the following few, too, because I expect this to
get quite long), I would like to talk about an idea that over the past six
months has come to become a tenet of the way I think about quantum mechanics,
Hodge theory, $$S^1$$-actions, filtrations, etc. The core idea is expressed in
the following equation:

$$\text{In characteristic zero, }\beta = u \simeq \hbar \simeq \lambda.$$

Here, $$\beta$$ (denoted equivalently by $$u$$) is the degree $$-2$$ Bott
element in $$\pi_{-2} A^{\CP^\infty_+}$$ (where $$A$$ is a complex oriented ring
spectrum); $$\hbar$$ is the Planck constant; and $$\lambda$$ is the parameter in
"$$\lambda$$-connections" that encodes the order filtration on D-modules (or
more generally the parameter appearing in the Rees construction of a filtered
module), i.e., the Hodge filtration.

Here's the plan for this post (these posts?). I'm going to try to give an
exposition of (perturbative) quantum mechanics/field theory as motivation for
deformation quantization; use that to say a bit about deformation quantization
of symplectic manifolds from the modern point of view, as pioneered by
Kontsevich; talk about how this is analogous to the degeneration of the Hodge-de
Rham spectral sequence; briefly go over nonabelian Hodge theory (again!); then
go back to the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence and state what it's got to do
with Hochschild homology and circle actions, where we'll see that the Bott
element corresponds to the deformation parameter/"the Planck constant". Then, we
will use our equation relating $$u$$, $$\hbar$$, and $$\lambda$$ to discuss
deformation quantization in characteristic $$p$$ from the more
homotopically-flavored point of view; we'll see that quantized algebras
(following [Bezrukavnikov-Kaledin](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0501247))
essentially come from $$S^1$$-actions, and that restricted structures on
quantized algebras can be viewed as the Dyer-Lashof operation $$Q_1$$. (In fact,
we will see that cyclotomic spectra are the homotopical analogues of
Frobenius-constant quantizations.) I haven't tried to prove something like the
Azumaya algebra property from Proposition 1.24 (see also Lemma 3.2) of their
paper, but it should certainly be doable (although, as far as I understand,
their techniques don't really generalize to the homotopical setting).

We will start off in characteristic zero, and will switch over to characteristic
$$p$$ later; in fact, until mentioned otherwise, you should just assume that the
base field is $$\cc$$.

### Part one: $$\hbar$$/deformation quantization

Let's begin with a review of quantum theory; there's a lot to say here, so I
will say only the minimal amount necessary to get to the math. It's not really
crucial to understand the physics if you're willing to forego the motivation; if
you don't want to read the physics motivation, just skip down to where we start
talking about Poisson brackets. 

There are at least two approaches to time evolution in quantum mechanics: in the
Schrodinger picture, the states evolve through time (as described by the
Schrodinger equation), while the operators (like the Hamiltonian) remains
constant; in the Heisenbeg picture, the states remain constant, while the
operators evolve through time. In the Schrodinger picture, the equation of
motion $$i\hbar |\dot{\psi}(t)\rangle = H|\psi(t)\rangle$$ can be solved to give
$$|\psi(t)\rangle = U(t) |\psi(0)\rangle$$, where $$U(t)$$ is a time evolution
operator (which is $$e^{-iHt/\hbar}$$, if the Hamiltonian $$H$$ is
time-independent). In the Heisenberg picture, the state $$|\psi(0)\rangle$$
remains constant, while an operator $$A$$ evolves as $$A_t = U(t)^\dagger A
U(t)$$. Using the Schrodinger equation, one can show that the the equation of
motion in the Heisenberg picture is

$$\frac{d}{dt} A_t = \frac{i}{\hbar} [H, A_t] + U(t)^\dagger (\partial_t A)
U(t).$$

(If $$A$$ has no time dependence, then the final term vanishes.) The upshot is
that the dynamical variables in the Schrodinger picture are the states, while
the dynamical variables in the Heisenberg picture are the operators.

Now, given a classical system, one can try to construct a corresponding quantum
theory. There are many ways of doing so: for example, the Lagrangian formalism
in classical mechanics can be quantized via the path integral formalism (which
is the easiest to do calculations with, at least perturbatively, and which is
equivalent to the Schrodinger and Heisenberg pictures); the Hamiltonian
formalism in classical mechanics can be approached canonical quantization, where
it can be studied via the Schrodinger and Heisenberg pictures. In canonical
quantization, one promotes classical dynamical variables like position and
momentum to operators. *Geometric* quantization (which I don't understand) seems
to focus on quantization via the Schrodinger picture, while *deformation*
quantization focuses on the Heisenberg picture.

To motivate how deformation quantization focuses on the Heisenberg picture,
recall that Hamilton's equation of motion in classical mechanics states that if
$$f(p,q,t)$$ is a function on the phase space of our classical system (where
$$p$$ is position, $$q$$ is momentum, and $$t$$ is time), then

$$\frac{d}{dt} f(p,q,t) = \{f,H\} + \partial_t f.$$

Here, $$\{f,H\}$$ is the Poisson bracket (in canonical coordinates, it is
$$\sum_i \partial_{q_i} f \partial_{p_i} H - \partial_{p_i} f \partial_{q_i}
H$$). The upshot is that, in the Heisenberg picture, the Poisson bracket
$$\{f,g\}$$ is quantized to $$-\frac{i}{\hbar} [f,g]$$. So, if $$M$$ is a
manifold equipped with a Poisson bracket, we might define a quantization of
$$M$$ to be a product on $$C^\infty(M)[\![\hbar]\!]$$ (where $$\hbar$$ is a
formal variable) such that the commutator is given by

$$f\star g - g\star f \equiv i\hbar \{f,g\} \pmod{\hbar^2}.$$

In the algebraic setting, if $$X$$ is a smooth variety with a Poisson bracket,
then we can define a quantization to be a flat associative
$$\cc[\![\hbar]\!]$$-algebra $$\co_\hbar$$ (with product denoted by $$\star$$)
such that $$\co_\hbar/\hbar = \co_X$$, and satisfying the same commutator
relation. For example, suppose $$X$$ is the formal affine plane
$$k[\![p,q]\!]$$, with Poisson bracket determined by the symplectic form
$$\omega = dq \wedge dp$$. Then, a quantization is given by
$$k[\![p,q]\!]/([p,q] = i\hbar)$$ (in fact, this is the only quantization). Note
that, in particular, setting $$\hbar = 0$$ takes us back to the classical world,
just as one would expect from a physical point of view: at a scale when
$$\hbar$$ is tiny, quantum mechanical effects cease to be significant.

It is important to note that if you're scourging the literature for perturbative
expansions and you're finding that $$\hbar$$ just doesn't appear anywhere, it's
because physicists set $$\hbar = 1$$ in quantum mechanical calculations. These
are "natural units", but, as we shall see when talking about Hodge theory,
setting $$\hbar$$ to $$1$$ has real mathematical content (even though it means
having divergent formal power series expansions in quantum mechanics).

(Before I proceed, I'd just like to say that one can also observe that $$\hbar
\to 0$$ in the path integral approach also reduces to the classical story.
Here's a disappointing-even-to-physicists-level-of-rigor argument. If $$x$$ and
$$y$$ are points, then the probability amplitude for a particle to go from $$x$$
to $$y$$ in a time $$t$$ is given by $$\langle y|e^{-iHt/\hbar}|x\rangle = \int
\cd f e^{iS[f]/\hbar}$$, where the integral is over the space of paths. Now,
suppose that $$\hbar \to 0$$. Then, the contribution from two paths $$f$$ and
$$g$$ do cancel each other out (constructively interfere) iff $$S[f]$$ is
approximately $$S[g]$$. Roughly, this means that $$f$$ and $$g$$ are close to
each other, and $$S$$ is maximized at $$f$$. So, as $$\hbar\to 0$$, there's only
one dominating contribution for the integral for the probability amplitude
coming from a path $$f$$ which extremizes the action. By Euler-Lagrange, this is
the classical trajectory of the particle. If you want to see a more precise
discussion, the keyword here is "stationary phase approximation", and
essentially boils down to Taylor expanding the action around a critical point to
the second order, combined with the fact that

$$\int^\infty_{-\infty} e^{iax^2/2 + ibx} = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi i}{a}}
e^{-ib^2/2a},$$

which in turn can be proved by completing the square in the exponential and
using the classical calculation of the integral of $$e^{-x^2}$$.)

Kontsevich's theorem is that every Poisson manifold has a deformation
quantization. In fact, he gave an explicit formula for the product $$\star$$ as
a perturbative expansion of a path integral via Feynman diagrams.

We won't need to know the proof (because we'll soon be talking about a different
formality statement), but it is a great result, so we'll sketch it anyway. A
proof of Kontsevich's theorem goes by reducing to showing that the Hochschild
cochains are a formal dg-Lie algebra.  Indeed, if $$X$$ is a smooth
variety/manifold, then the HKR theorem says that the Hochschild cohomology of
$$X$$ is quasi-isomorphic to the dg-algebra of polyvector fields on $$X$$ (i.e.,
$$\H^0(X; \bigwedge^{\ast+1} T_X)$$) with zero differential. The deformations of
$$X$$ are controlled by the dg-Lie algebra given by the Hochschild homology with
the Gerstenhaber bracket; namely, deformations of $$X$$ are classified by
solutions to the Maurer-Cartan equation $$dx + \frac{1}{2} [x,x] = 0$$ in this
dg-Lie algebra. On the other hand, solutions to the Maurer-Cartan equation in
$$\H^0(X; \bigwedge^{\ast+1} T_X)$$ with the usual Lie bracket are in bijection
with Poisson structures on $$X$$: if $$\omega\in \H^0(X;\bigwedge^2 T_X)$$, then
the Poisson bracket $$\{f,g\}$$ is given by $$\omega(f\otimes g)$$. So, if the
HKR quasi-isomorphism $$\HH^\bullet(X) \simeq \H^0(X; \bigwedge^{\ast+1} T_X)$$
could be upgraded to a quasi-isomorphism of *dg-Lie algebras*, then we'd see
that every Poisson structure on $$X$$ gives rise to a deformation of $$X$$.
(There's an issue here, namely that the quasi-isomorphism of the HKR theorem
doesn't actually respect the bracket, but it can be *corrected* to one, in the
sense that the first "Taylor coefficient" of the correction is the HKR map; see
4.6.2 [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9709040). These correction terms are
where the path integral stuff comes from.)

By the Deligne conjecture, the Hochschild cochains admit the structure of an
$$\E_2$$-algebra, and one can then formally reduce (ha) the desired formality
statement (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9904055.pdf)) to showing that
the $$\E_2$$-operad is formal in characteristic zero. This was proved by
Kontsevich (for the $$\E_n$$-operad in characteristic zero in general). As a
remark, the homology of the $$\E_2$$-operad in characteristic zero encodes the
structure of a Gerstenhaber algebra (where the Gerstenhaber bracket is given by
the Browder bracket).

In the next post, we will talk about Hodge theory.
