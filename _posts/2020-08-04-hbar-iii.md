### Part three: $$u$$/the trusty circle

So far, we have seen that the $$\lambda$$ in $$\lambda$$-connections (which
encodes the Hodge filtration) should be viewed as $$\hbar$$ from deformation
quantization/Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov, which we saw is the same thing as the Bott
element. In this post, I would like to take this one step further, and argue
that the Bott class is/should be the key object around which the stories of
quantization and filtrations/Rees objects revolves. (I'm certain that this is
something that experts like Kontsevich know, but it's been pretty hard to track
down references where this is explicitly said.) One of the reasons for this
perspective is that the Bott class admits a canonical "lift to the sphere
spectrum", and as such tells us how to approach quantization and friends in
characteristic $$p$$ (or, more generally, over any structured ring spectrum).

To motivate this perspective, let us look at the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem
and Hodge-de Rham degeneration in characteristic $$p$$, as a way of inching
closer to the universal base $$S^0$$. There's a
[version](http://reh.math.uni-duesseldorf.de/~schroeer/publications_pdf/lifting.pdf)
of BTT for Calabi-Yaus in characteristic $$p$$, albeit under some rather strong
assumptions: the Calabi-Yau should lift to the Witt vectors, and the de Rham
cohomology of this lift should be free (well, this is *almost* the condition).
Using the perspective on BTT as coming from the triviality of the $$S^1$$-action
on Hochschild homology that we described in our last post, it is possible to
extend Schroer's result to the milder assumptions that $$p$$ is larger than the
dimension of our Calabi-Yau $$X$$, and that $$X$$ lifts to $$W_2(k)$$.

These assumptions also showed up in work of Deligne-Illusie, where (in one of my
favorite papers ever) they showed that these assumptions on $$X$$ (not
necessarily Calabi-Yau, just smooth and proper over a perfect field $$k$$ of
characteristic $$p>0$$) implies that the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence
degenerates. We already saw in the previous post that the relationship between
$$\lambda$$ (the parameter keeping track of the Hodge filtration) and the Bott
element $$u$$ manifests itself as the relationship between the Hodge-de Rham
spectral sequence and the Tate spectral sequence for Hochschild homology;
therefore, one might expect that for certain smooth and proper $$k$$-linear
stable presentable $$\infty$$-categories, the Tate spectral sequence for
Hochschild homology degenerates. This is in fact the case, and a readable
exposition is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09045).

(The careful reader might notice that the situation might actually be slightly
worse than in the characteristic zero case, where the problem stems not from the
Tate or Hodge-de Rham spectral sequences, but rather from the HKR spectral
sequence. In characteristic zero, the HKR spectral sequence degenerated at
$$E_1$$, and so we could conclude from our square of spectral sequences that the
Tate spectral sequence degenerates for $$\HH(X/k)$$ if and only if the Hodge-de
Rham spectral sequence degenerates. As it turns out, though, the HKR spectral
sequence need *not* degenerate at the $$E_1$$-page for arbitrary smooth proper
$$k$$-schemes. It *does* degenerate, however, once $$\dim(X)< p$$. This is one
of the Deligne-Illusie assumptions, and so if those conditions are satisfied,
then the Tate spectral sequence degenerates if and only if the Hodge-de Rham
spectral sequence degenerates.)

We can then ask for a categorified version of Hodge theory (i.e., nonabelian
Hodge theory) in characteristic $$p$$. We briefly discussed this
[here](/blog/algebraic-topology/2020/07/18/nah-redux.html), so the reader should
read that post. The restrictions on the nilpotence order there are nothing but
categorifications of the Deligne-Illusie conditions; see section 2.5 in
[Ogus-Vologodsky](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0507476) for the precise
conditions. Given that the Hodge filtration is measured by $$\lambda$$, and
$$\lambda = u$$, we can finally ask for a "$$2$$-periodic version" of the
nonabelian Hodge correspondence in characteristic $$p$$. Again, we discussed
this [here](/blog/algebraic-topology/2020/07/18/nah-redux.html), so I'll refer
the reader there again, rather than repeat what I wrote.

It will be important for our discussion to note that the *non-degeneration* of
the HKR spectral sequence means that Hochschild homology in characteristic $$p$$
is not necessarily formal (as an $$\Eoo$$-$$k$$-algebra). In other words,
$$\HH(X/k)$$ is not equivalent to $$\gr(\tau_{\geq \star} \HH(X/k)) =
\Omega^\bullet_X$$. The $$S^1$$-action on $$\HH(X/k)$$ is supposed to give the
de Rham differential on $$\Omega^\bullet_X$$ --- but *unlike* in characteristic
zero, the datum of a differential is *not* equivalent to an $$S^1$$-action. This
is because $$C_\ast(S^1;k)$$ is *not* equivalent to $$\H_\ast(S^1;k) \simeq
k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2$$ as an $$\Eoo$$-ring; in other words, $$S^1$$ is not
formal.

This is a very important fact to remember. There is a way to fix this, described
in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02576): rather than worrying about
proving formality, one just keeps track of the entire Whitehead filtration, and
works in the world of filtered $$\Eoo$$-$$k$$-algebras. (If the algebras under
consideration are formal, then the Whitehead filtration collapses, and so this
amounts to just working in graded $$k$$-algebras.) In particular, rather than
trying (and failing, because it's not true) to prove formality of Hochschild
homology with its $$S^1$$-action in characteristic $$p$$, we should just work
with the *filtered* object $$\tau_{\geq \star} \HH(X/k)$$ with the action of
$$\tau_{\geq \star} k[S^1]$$ instead. The associated graded of this is
$$\gr(\tau_{\geq \star} \HH(X/k)) = \Omega^\ast_X$$ with its $$\gr(\tau_{\geq
\star} k[S^1]) = \H_\ast(S^1;k) = k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2$$-action by the de Rham
differential.

The HKR spectral sequence collapses in characteristic $$p$$ in *some* cases,
namely when $$\dim(X)< p$$. This means that there can't be a
$$d_r$$-differential if $$r < p$$, and that Hochschild homology is formal for
these schemes. The $$S^1$$-action is also formal, in the following sense: under
the equivalence $$\Fun(BS^1, \Mod(k)) \simeq \Mod(k^{hS^1})$$, we can view
$$\HH(X/k)$$ with its $$S^1$$-action (at least, as a Borel $$S^1$$-spectrum) as
a $$k^{hS^1}$$-module. Now, $$k^{hS^1} = C^\ast(\CP^\infty;k)$$ is the
$$\E_1$$-Koszul dual of $$k[S^1] = C_\ast(S^1;k)$$, and so the non-formality of
$$C_\ast(S^1;k)$$ is the same as the non-formality of $$C^\ast(\CP^\infty;k)$$.
The desired formality statement is then that even though
$$C^\ast(\CP^\infty;k)$$ is not formal, it is formal *through a range*: the
$$\Eoo$$-$$k$$-algebra $$\tau_{\leq 2p-4} C^\ast(\CP^\infty;k)$$ is formal.

Before we proceed, let us briefly digress to discuss the characteristic $$p$$
analogue of Kontsevich's result. Again, the HKR spectral sequence collapses in
characteristic $$p$$ in some cases. In characteristic zero, the HKR spectral
sequence collapsing was the first step (literally, the first Taylor
approximation) to Kontsevich's quasi-isomorphism between the Hochschild
cohomology dg-Lie algebra and its homotopy (the algebra of polyvector fields).
We saw that this formality stems from the rational formality of the
$$\E_2$$-operad. I recently came across [this
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09191.pdf), which says that the
$$\E_2$$-operad is formal through a range. In particular, Corollary A of this
paper should lead to a proof of:

**Informal Conjecture:** Kontsevich formality (i.e., $$\HH(X/k)[1]$$ is
equivalent as a dg-Lie algebra to its homotopy) holds for smooth proper schemes
$$X$$ over a perfect field of characteristic $$p$$ for which $$\dim(X)< p$$.

---

Let's now return to the main program. We've seen that, in characteristic zero,
the Bott class is just the filtration parameter $$\lambda$$, which in turn is
the deformation quantization parameter $$\hbar$$. However, this fails in a sense
in characteristic $$p$$: we have seen that the Bott class is really a
consequence of having an $$S^1$$-action (e.g., $$\pi_\ast \HP(X/k)$$ is a
$$k^{tS^1}$$-module because $$S^1$$ acts on $$\HH(X/k)$$). However, because
$$C^\ast(\CP^\infty;k) = k^{hS^1}$$ is not formal, we cannot really say that the
Bott class "lives in" $$\HP(X/k)$$, only that it lives in $$\pi_\ast \HP(X/k)$$.
Since, in characteristic $$p$$, we cannot get by with only knowing the action of
$$u$$ (which is sufficient in characteristic zero by formality), we really need
to keep track of the entire $$S^1$$-action. This allows to finally arrive at the
thesis of these posts:

**Slogan:** The datum of an $$S^1$$-action on an object $$M$$ is the homotopical
version of the datum of a filtration. Moreover, the triviality of this
$$S^1$$-action is analogous to the existence of a deformation quantization. (The
first sentence relates $$u$$ and $$\lambda$$, while the second relates $$u$$ and
$$\hbar$$.)

We can make this slogan a little more precise, but to do so, we need to revisit
something we briefly mentioned at the end of the previous post. Recall that if
$$\F^\star A$$ is a filtered $$k$$-algebra, then the Rees construction is the
filtered $$k[\lambda]$$-module $$\bigoplus_{i\geq 0} (\F^i A) \lambda^i$$. In
other words, powers of $$\lambda$$ keep track of the filtration on $$A$$.
Therefore, ccording to our equation $$\lambda = u$$, powers of $$u$$ should keep
track of a filtration on the homotopy fixed points $$\pi_\ast(M^{hS^1})$$ of an
$$S^1$$-action on $$M$$. This filtration isn't terribly surprising: it is
exactly the filtration coming from the homotopy fixed points spectral sequence

$$E_2^{\ast,\ast} = \H^\ast(\CP^\infty; \pi_\ast M) \Rightarrow
\pi_\ast(M^{hS^1}).$$

(Note that if $$M$$ is a $$k$$-algebra, then the $$E_2$$-page is $$(\pi_\ast
M)[\![u]\!]$$.) This filtration is exactly the resulting $$u$$-adic filtration
on $$\pi_\ast(M^{hS^1})$$. We said above that the action of $$u$$ on
$$\pi_\ast(M^{hS^1})$$ isn't really "sufficient" for studying $$S^1$$-actions
away from characteristic zero, so we should be looking for a homotopical version
of the $$u$$-adic filtration on a $$k^{hS^1}$$-module $$M^{hS^1}$$.

Luckily, we already know of such a thing: just look at the filtration on
$$M^{hS^1}$$ induced by the filtration

$$\F^i k^{hS^1} = \F^i C^\ast(\CP^\infty;k) = C^\ast(\CP^\infty_i; k).$$

Computing the effect on homotopy shows that this is indeed a homotopical
refinement of the $$u$$-adic filtration.  This allows us to arrive at the
following refined slogan.

**Slightly refined slogan:** An $$S^1$$-action on a $$k$$-module $$M$$ gives
rise to the "$$\CP$$-filtration" on $$M^{hS^1}$$, and the resulting filtration
on homotopy is analogous to the datum of a filtration. Moreover,
the triviality of this $$S^1$$-action is analogous to the existence of a
deformation quantization.

One very appealing aspect of this slogan is that the $$\CP$$-filtration is not
only defined on $$k$$-modules with an $$S^1$$-action, but on all spectra with an
$$S^1$$-action. In other words, this slogan allows us to study "deformation
quantization over the sphere spectrum".

Before we get too excited, there are some subtleties that we need to discuss.
First, if $$M$$ is a $$k$$-module with an $$S^1$$-action, we get a filtered
$$\F^\star k^{hS^1}$$-module $$\F^\star M^{hS^1}$$, as described above.
*However*, as discussed
[here](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/papers/Waldhaus.pdf), the *filtered*
spectrum $$\F^\star k^{hS^1}$$ over an arbitrary $$\Eoo$$-ring $$k$$ will only
be a *filtered $$\E_2$$-ring spectrum* via the diagonal on $$\{\CP^\infty_n\}$$,
and *not* a filtered $$\Eoo$$-ring (or even a filtered $$\E_3$$-ring, although
Lurie only states this and doesn't prove it).

Next, one might be a tad bit surprised to see the claim that "modules over
$$k^{hS^1}$$" are supposed to be homotopical versions of filtrations, for the
following reason. If $$\Sp_\gr$$ is the category of graded spectra and
$$\Sp_\fil$$ the category of filtered spectra, then there is a canonical
$$\Eoo$$-algebra $$S^0[t]\in \CAlg(\Sp_\gr)$$ such that modules over $$S^0[t]$$
in graded spectra are filtered spectra. Indeed, just let the $$n$$th graded
piece of $$S^0[t]$$ be $$S^0$$ if $$n\geq 0$$, and zero if $$n<0$$. The action
of "$$t$$" (which generates the copy of $$S^0$$ in graded degree $$1$$) on the
graded spectrum gives the transition maps necessary to get a filtered spectrum
out of the graded spectrum.

On the other hand, modules over $$k^{hS^1}$$ (or, rather, $$\gr(\F^\star
k^{hS^1}) = k[u]$$) in graded spectra are graded $$k$$-modules $$\bigoplus_n
M_n$$ along with maps $$M_n \to \Sigma^2 M_{n+1}$$. We see that $$S^0[t]$$ looks
rather different from $$k^{hS^1}$$: in a sense, it is a "sheared" version of
$$S^0[t]$$. This was mentioned at the end of the previous post, where we said
that fixing the grading in the nonabelian Hodge correspondence (to get the Rees
variable $$\lambda$$ to live in degree $$2$$) is a sort of shearing procedure.
We can now see why this isn't exactly how one should be thinking of the passage
from $$S^0[t]$$-modules: for instance, while $$k[t] = k\otimes_{S^0} S^0[t]$$ is
a filtered $$\Eoo$$-ring, $$\F^\star k^{hS^1}$$ is only $$\E_2$$; moreover, it's
not obvious how one might start with a filtered spectrum and then "shear" it.

Nonetheless, the passage isn't *completely* mysterious: the underlying object of
$$S^0[t]$$ is the suspension spectrum $$\Sigma^\infty_+ \Z_{\geq 0}$$, and this
is an augmented $$\E_2$$-algebra. We can then take its 2-fold bar construction
(i.e., the $$\E_2$$-Koszul dual), and this gives $$(S^0)^{hS^1}$$. All of this
works in the filtered setting, too: if $$\Sigma^\infty_+ \Z_{\geq 0}$$ is given
the filtration $$\F^n \Sigma^\infty_+ \Z_{\geq 0} = \Sigma^\infty_+ \{0, \cdots,
n\}$$, then the $$\E_2$$-Koszul dual in filtered spectra is $$\F^\star
(S^0)^{hS^1} = C^\ast(\CP^\infty_\star; S^0)$$.

At this point, it is apt to remark that the connection between deformation
quantization and the fact that $$\gr(\F^\star k^{hS^1}) = k[\![u]\!]$$ is the
$$\E_2$$-Koszul dual of $$k[t]$$ has already been studied by many. See, for
instance, Theorem 5.1 in Toen's 2014 [ICM
address](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6995): if $$k$$ is a field of characteristic
zero, the deformation theory of a compactly generated $$k$$-linear dg-category
$$\cC$$ is controlled by the Hochschild cohomology of $$\cC$$, and deformations
of $$\cC$$ to $$k[t]$$ are the same as $$k[\![u]\!]$$-module structures on
$$\cC$$.  We can now see that our slogan allows us to generalize Toen's
statement to arbitary $$\Eoo$$-rings $$R$$: the deformation theory of a
compactly generated $$R$$-linear presentable stable $$\infty$$-category $$\cC$$
is controlled by the Hochschild cohomology, and deformations of $$\cC$$ to
$$R[t] = R \otimes_{S^0} S^0[t]$$ are the same as $$R^{hS^1}$$-linear structures
on $$\cC$$, or rather $$R$$-linear presentable stable $$\infty$$-categories
$$\cd$$ with an $$S^1$$-action such that $$\cC \simeq \cd^{hS^1}$$. Because
$$k[\![u]\!]$$ is the associated graded of the $$\CP$$-filtration on
$$k^{hS^1}$$, and it *is* $$k^{hS^1}$$ in characteristic zero, this reduces to
Toen's result in characteristic zero. The above statement, however, works for
any $$\Eoo$$-ring, and hence in particular for any field (regardless of
characteristic).

In the next post, we will explore what happens in characteristic $$p$$. Let's
end this post with a remark. In previous posts, we focused primarily on what
happens when we set $$\hbar = 0$$ (which corresponds to going from quantum
mechanics to classical mechanics) and $$\lambda = 0$$ (which corresponds to
taking the associated graded). However, it is common in quantum mechanics to set
$$\hbar = 1$$ --- this goes by the name "natural units". Our main equation tells
us that this corresponds to setting $$\lambda = 1$$ in the filtered world; this
just means "working with the underlying unfiltered object".  Unfortunately, in
the homotopical world, it doesn't really make sense to "set $$u$$ to $$1$$",
because $$u$$ lives in degree 2, while $$1$$ lives in degree 0. But this isn't
that big of a deal: we can just *invert* $$u$$ instead, and this amounts to
taking the Tate construction in $$S^1$$-homotopy theory. We've already seen this
perspective in action in [this
post](/blog/algebraic-topology/2020/07/18/nah-redux.html), where we argued that
a homotopical version of the (characteristic $$p$$) nonabelian Hodge
correspondence is really supposed to be a Frobenius-linear equivalence between a
certain subcategory of $$\fr{Z}(\cC) \otimes_k k^{tS^1}$$ and
$$\fr{Z}(\cC)^{hS^1} \otimes_{k^{hS^1}} k^{tS^1}$$, where $$\cC$$ is a
$$k$$-linear stable presentable category and $$\fr{Z}(\cC)$$ denotes its
$$\E_2$$-center.
