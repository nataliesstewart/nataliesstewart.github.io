Last time, I mentioned a project that I've been working on with a grad student
in the physics department. We're trying to understand anomaly cancellations, and
there's a slick argument of Witten's (I think? I learnt it from [this
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04715.pdf)) which explains this via the
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. Let's recall the setup. We'll work in
Euclidean signature.

Let $$M$$ be an odd-dimensional manifold (one-dimensional time direction), and
consider a massless Dirac fermion $$\psi$$ on $$M$$, with action

$$S = \int_M \ol{\psi} i \dir \psi,$$

where $$\dir$$ is the Dirac operator. (OK, we should assume that the manifold is
spin, etc. But we're contemplating physics, so I'm gonna allow assumptions to
remain implicit.) Then, the path integral $$Z_\psi$$ of the $$\psi$$-field is
the determinant of the imaginary Dirac operator $$i\dir$$. Because $$i\dir$$ is
Hermitian (boils down to the Hermitian-ness of the gamma matrices), its
eigenvalues $$\lambda_i$$ are real, and so $$Z_\psi = \prod_i \lambda_i$$. From
a physical perspective, this stems from time-reversal invariance (for which the
masslessness of our fermion is important): time-reversal has the effect of
conjugating the partition function.

Now, the product $$\prod_i \lambda_i$$ is real, but its sign is not
well-defined.  To see this, couple to a background gauge field $$A$$ and metric
$$g$$ such that $$Z_\psi$$ is real for this configuration. Consider a gauge
transformation $$\phi$$ which sends $$(A,g)$$ to $$(A^\phi, g^\phi)$$, and
consider the straight line in the configuration space of the field theory
connecting $$(A, g)$$ to $$(A^\phi, g^\phi)$$. Then the gauge-invariance of the
Dirac operator implies that the spectrum of the Dirac operator for both of these
background field configurations is the same --- but the "spectral flow" of the
Dirac operator implies that the "number of positive/negative eigenvalues" (that
phrase doesn't make mathematical sense, because there are infinitely many
eigenvalues) could change. In particular, the sign of $$Z_\psi$$ changes
everytime an eigenvalue of the Dirac operator passes through zero under this
straight-line path in the configuration space. This is called the parity
anomaly: the sign of $$Z_\psi$$ isn't well-defined.

That doesn't mean that the theory is inconsistent, just that we can't quantize
it without violating time-reversal invariance. Let's introduce a Pauli-Villars
regulator (so we're cutting off the mass at some $$\Lambda$$); then, the
regulated determinant of $$i\dir$$ is 

$$\det(i\dir) = \prod \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + i\Lambda}.$$

If $$\Lambda$$ is large, then each $$\lambda_i$$ contributes the phase $$-i$$ or
$$i$$ to $$Z_\psi$$, depending on the sign of $$\lambda_i$$. So 

$$Z_\psi = |Z_\psi| \exp\left(-\frac{i\pi}{2} \sum
\mathrm{sign}(\lambda_i)\right).$$

Again, we need to write down this infinite sum $$\sum \mathrm{sign}(\lambda_i)$$
properly. This is the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer $$\eta$$-invariant $$\eta(i\dir)$$:
it could be taken to be

$$\eta(i\dir) = \lim_{s\to 0^+} \sum \mathrm{sign}(\lambda_i)
|\lambda_i|^{-s}.$$

There's actually an expression for the $$\eta$$-invariant (due to Melrose?) as a
Mellin transform

$$\eta(i\dir) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^\infty t^{-1/2} \mathrm{Tr}\left(
\dir \ e^{-t {\dir}^2}\right) dt.$$

In any case, if we take this to be the regulated definition of the partition
function, then the sign ambiguity is resolved, and the resulting expression for
$$Z_\psi$$ is gauge invariant. The only issue we have left is that $$Z_\psi$$ is
not time-reversal invariant. This manifests as the fact that $$Z_\psi$$ need not
be real. Note that we can also equally well choose a regularization such that
$$Z_\psi = |Z_\psi| e^{i\pi\eta/2}$$ (rather than $$Z_\psi = |Z_\psi|
e^{-i\pi\eta/2}$$).

It's clear that we're trying real hard to get the index of the Dirac operator to
show up, but all we've got is thee $$\eta$$-invariant. This is fixed by the
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. Suppose that our $$d$$-dimensional manifold
$$M$$ is the boundary of a $$(d+1)$$-manifold $$N$$ (the "bulk"), and that our
fermion field $$\psi$$ is a boundary mode of some fermion field on $$N$$ (and
assume that the spin structure, gauge fields, etc. also extend to $$N$$). Then
adding on "gravitational terms" (the A-hat genus) to the bulk leads to the
combined bulk-boundary system being time-reversal invariant (i.e., the partition
function of the bulk-boundary system is real).  Namely, if $$\Phi$$ denotes the
Atiyah-Singer characteristic class (living in cohomological dimension $$d+1$$;
this can be expressed in terms of the A-hat genus of $$N$$; Chern-Weil theory
gives an expression for this in terms of curvature, and so it's a "gravitational
term"), then introduce the action

$$S = i\pi \int_N \Phi$$

on the "bulk" $$N$$. The combined bulk-boundary system has partition function

$$Z_\bb = Z_\psi e^{-S} = |Z_\psi| \exp\left(\frac{i\pi}{2} \eta(i\dir) - i \pi
\int_N \Phi\right).$$

The Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem states that 

$$\frac{1}{2} \eta(i\dir) - \int_N \Phi = \mathrm{index}({\dir}_N).$$

So the combined bulk-boundary system has partition function $$Z_\bb := |Z_\psi|
(-1)^{\mathrm{index}(\dir)}$$. Because the index of the Dirac operator is an
integer, the path integral is real; it is also invariant under time-reversal and
gauge transformations.

Although we've resolved these issues, we've introduced a new one in the process
of fixing them: if it does not depend on the choice of $$N$$, then $$Z_\bb$$
would be a good definition of the path integral for the fermion field on $$M$$.
To emphasize this possible dependence, let's write $$Z_\bb[N]$$ for $$Z_\bb$$.
Let's suppose that $$N'$$ is another $$(d+1)$$-manifold with $$\partial N' = M$$
over which all the relevant structures extend. We'd like to compare $$Z_\bb[N]$$
and $$Z_\bb[N']$$.

We can glue $$N$$ and $$N'$$ (the latter with opposite orientation) along the
boundary $$M$$ to obtain a closed $$(d+1)$$-manifold $$W$$. Then the ratio
between $$Z_\bb[N]$$ and $$Z_\bb[N']$$ is

$$\frac{Z_\bb[N]}{Z_\bb[N']} = \exp\left(-i\pi \eta_W(\dir)/2\right).$$

So: what we'd like is for $$\exp\left(-i\pi \eta_W(\dir)/2\right)$$ to be equal
to $$1$$. Suppose that this closed $$(d+1)$$-manifold $$W$$ is further the
boundary of a $$(d+2)$$-manifold $$U$$, and that the Dirac operator on $$W$$
extends to $$U$$. Then the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem on $$U$$ says that

$$\mathrm{index}({\dir}_U) = \int_U \Phi_{d+2} - \frac{\eta_W}{2}.$$

The $$(d+2)$$-form $$\Phi_{d+2}$$ is the "anomaly polynomial" of the
$$d$$-dimensional fermion field $$\psi$$, provided $$U$$ exists: this is by
definition of the anomaly polynomial coupled with the above observation that the
anomaly inflow of $$\psi$$ is related to $$\eta_W/2$$. So $$\Phi_{d+2}$$
vanishes iff $$\psi$$ is free of (perturbative?) anomalies.

In this case ($$\Phi_{d+2}$$ vanishing), we find that $$\eta_W/2$$ is an
integer.  Since we wanted $$\exp\left(-i\pi \eta_W(\dir)/2\right) = 1$$, the
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer implies that this would suffice if we knew that
$$\mathrm{index}({\dir}_U)$$ were even. This would in turn be the case if all
the eigenvalues of $${\dir}_U$$ had even multiplicity. I don't really understand
why this is the case, but the idea is to argue like in Kramers' theorem
(time-reversal symmetry in half-integer spin systems implies double degeneracy):
there is supposed to be an antilinear operator on $$U$$ which squares to $$-1$$
and commutes with $${\dir}_U$$.

What this implies is that if $$W = \partial U$$ and $$\Phi_{d+2}$$ vanishes,
then $$\exp\left(-i\pi \eta_W(\dir)/2\right) = 1$$. So if $$\psi$$ (the
$$d$$-dimensional fermion field we began with) has no perturbative anomaly, then
the "global anomaly" $${Z_\bb[N]}/{Z_\bb[N']}$$ is a cobordism invariant. In
particular, if $$W$$ is nullbordant, then $$Z_\bb[N]$$ is independent of our
choice of $$N$$, and thus serves as a good definition of the partition function
of $$\psi$$. Another way of saying this is that if $$G$$ is the symmetry group
with respect to which the $$d$$-dimensional theory is anomalous (so in this
case, $$G = \Z/2$$, generated by time-reversal), then the partition function
$$Z_\bb[N]$$ of the $$(d+1)$$-manifold $$N$$ defines a homomorphism
$$\mathrm{MSpin}_3(BG) \to \cc^\times$$. (Here we're using $$\mathrm{MSpin}$$,
because you need a spin structure to even define the Dirac operator.) That's
what [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7329) proposes. If you're a
homotopy theorist, you might say that 

$$\Hom(\pi_3(\MSpin\wedge BG_+), \cc^\times) = \Hom(\MSpin \wedge BG_+, \Sigma^3
I_{\cc^\times}),$$

where $$I_{\cc^\times}$$ is the Brown-Comenetz dualizing spectrum. This is
basically the Freed-Hopkins approach to classifying SPT phases of matter.

The story told above can be written in somewhat more abstract terms as follows.
There's a general principle stating that $$d$$-dimensional anomalies are
controlled by invertible $$(d+1)$$-dimensional topological quantum field
theories.  It's fairly easy to see this from an intuitive point-of-view (we
haven't been doing anything else so far!). Suppose you have a $$d$$-dimensional
anomaly associated to some quantum field theory $$Z$$. Then if $$M^d$$ is a
closed manifold, the complex number $$Z(M^d)$$ has some phase ambiguity. The
idea is to think of $$Z(M^d)$$ as a vector in a one-dimensional complex vector
space. (The phase ambiguity is absorbed by the fact that this vector space
doesn't have a preferred basis.) An invertible $$(d+1)$$-dimensional TQFT is
exactly an assignment of a one-dimensional vector space to a $$d$$-dimensional
closed manifold. Then $$Z$$ is the "anomaly theory" of the $$(d+1)$$-dimensional
invertible TQFT. In the condensed matter literature, $$Z$$ is called the
boundary edge mode of the $$(d+1)$$-dimensional bulk SPT phase.

The discussion above shows that the example of a massless Dirac fermion on an
odd-dimensional manifold which is time-reversal invariant leads to a parity
anomaly. The associated $$(d+1)$$-dimensional invertible TQFT $$Q$$ is the one
which assigns to each $$(d+1)$$-dimensional manifold $$N$$ which is a cobordism
between $$d$$-manifolds $$M_0$$ and $$M_1$$ the linear transformation $$Q(M_0) =
\cc \to Q(M_1)= \cc$$ given by multiplication by
$$(-1)^{\mathrm{index}({\dir}_N)}$$.

Random cool stuff: $$d$$-dimensional anomalous $$G$$-theories with $$G$$ a
finite group are the same as elements of $$\H^{d+1}(BG; \cc^\times)$$. (In the
case $$d=1$$, this is the same as saying that anomalous $$G$$-theories are just
projective representations of $$G$$, which isn't terribly hard to see if you
just write down what it means to be an anomaly.) The anomaly cancellation in
this case is exactly provided by the Dijkgraaf-Witten theory corresponding to
the element of $$\H^{d+1}(BG; \cc^\times)$$. I guess you could think of this as
some finite group version of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem? (Random
thought: ambidexterity is supposed to construct some kind of higher chromatic
Dijkgraaf-Witten theory; what does "anomaly cancellation" mean in that exotic
context? Presumably there's no real physical interpretation, but the math might
be interesting.)
