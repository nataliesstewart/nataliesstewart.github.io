In the [previous post](/algebraic-topology/2019/07/24/witten-2.html), we argued
that the Witten genus $$\pi_\ast \MString \to \pi_\ast \tmf \to
\mathrm{MF}_\ast$$ is surjective on the image of $$\pi_\ast \tmf$$, where the
target is the ring of integral modular forms. (We actually argued that it's
$$p$$-adically and rationally surjective on the image of $$\pi_\ast \tmf$$ for
all primes $$p$$, but that's sufficient.) It is therefore natural to ask: what
are examples of String manifolds which hit the generators of the image of
$$\pi_\ast \tmf$$ in $$\mathrm{MF}_\ast$$?

Before answering this, let's figure out the analogous question for the other
orientations we know about. The mod $$2$$ Euler characteristic $$\pi_k \MO \to
\FF_2$$ is a surjection: its value on a product of real projective spaces is
$$1$$. The signature $$\pi_{4k} \MSO \to \Z$$ is a surjection: its value on a
product of complex projective spaces is $$1$$. The Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro
orientation goes $$\pi_\ast \MSpin \to \pi_\ast \ko$$. This, too, is [a
surjection](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970690) (we'd also given our own proof
of surjectivity [here](/algebraic-topology/2019/06/08/ko-thom.html)). Let's try
to construct explicit manifold representatives of the generators of $$\pi_\ast
\ko$$; since $$\pi_\ast \ko = \Z[\eta, \alpha, \beta]/(2\eta, \eta^3,
\eta\alpha, \alpha^2 - 4\beta)$$, we need to lift $$\eta$$, $$\alpha$$ (in
degree $$4$$), and $$\beta$$ (in degree $$8$$). This stuff is classical, but
we'll spell it out anyway because it's fun.

First, note that $$S^1$$ admits two inequivalent spin structures (corresponding
to the fact that $$\H^1(S^1;\FF_2) = \Z/2$$; but $$n$$-spheres for $$n\geq 2$$
admit unique spin structures), called the bounding and non-bounding
spin structures. (Note that from the obstruction-theoretic perspective,
orientability is equivalent to the trivializability of the tangent bundle over a
$$1$$-skeleton, while admitting a spin structure is equivalent to the
trivializability of the tangent bundle over a $$2$$-skeleton.) Since the frame
bundle for $$S^1$$ is just $$S^1$$, we find that these inequivalent spin
structures correspond to double covers, of which there are only two: the
connected and the disconnected one. The "non-bounding spin structure" gives a
lift of $$\eta\in \pi_1 \ko$$ to $$\pi_1 \MSpin$$.

Let's now turn to lifting of $$\alpha\in \pi_4\ko$$ and $$\beta\in \pi_8 \ko$$.
Milnor, in "Spin structures on manifolds" (page 201), writes down (without
proof) generators of $$\pi_4 \MSpin$$ and $$\pi_8 \MSpin$$: the generator in
dimension $$4$$ is a Kummer surface $$K$$, and the generator in dimension $$8$$
lifting $$\beta$$ is an $$8$$-manifold $$L$$ such that $$4L$$ is cobordant to
$$K^2 = K\times K$$. The Kummer surface is the hypersurface $$\{x_0^4 + \cdots +
x_3^4 = 0\}\subseteq \PP^3_\cc$$. 

As an aside, let's see why $$K$$ has a spin structure, and why it lifts
$$\alpha$$. Define $$H(n,d)$$ as the non-singular hypersurface in $$\CP^{n+1}$$
of degree $$d$$ (so it's the zero locus of a homogeneous polynomial of degree
$$d$$ whose derivative is nonvanishing at a nontrivial zero of the polynomial).
(Saying "the" non-singular hypersurface is *a priori* incorrect; one has to do
work to prove that all such hypersurfaces with the same $$n$$ and $$d$$ are
diffeomorphic.) Then $$c_1(H(n,d)) = (n+2-d)[x]$$, where $$[x]\in
\H^2(\CP^{n+1}; \Z)$$ is the generator pulled back to $$\H^2(H(n,d);\Z)$$. Since
a complex manifold $$M$$ is spin if and only if $$c_1(M)$$ is zero mod $$2$$ (in
general, a manifold is spin if and only if its second Steifel-Whitney class
vanishes), we find that $$H(n,d)$$ is spin if and only if $$n+d$$ is even. Since
$$K = H(2,4)$$, we find that $$K$$ is spin.

Now, the A-hat genus of a closed oriented $$4$$-manifold is $$\hat{A}(M) =
\langle -p_1(M)/24, [M]\rangle = -\sigma(M)/8$$, and so since $$\pi_4 \ko$$ is
$$2\Z$$ (we'd usually write it as $$\Z$$, but if you think aobut what's really
happening, e.g., in the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence, you'd see why
it's a $$2\Z$$), we find that to prove that the A-hat genus of $$K$$ is
$$\alpha$$, we just need to show that $$\sigma(K) = -16$$. This is a classical
calculation: recall that the Hirzebruch signature theorem tells us that
$$\sigma(M^4) = \langle p_1(M^4), [M^4]\rangle/3$$, and $$p_1(M^4)$$ is
$$-c_2(\tau_M \otimes \cc)$$.  We also know that $$-c_2(\tau_M \otimes \cc) =
c_1(M)^2 - 2c_2(M)$$, so we only need to calculate the Chern classes of $$K$$.
How do we do this? Well, $$K\subseteq \CP^3$$, and we know that
$$\tau_{\CP^3}|_K/\tau_K \cong N_K$$, where $$N_K$$ is the normal bundle. Since
$$K$$ is a hypersurface of degree $$4$$, we find that $$N_K$$ is a line bundle,
and that it's actually the pullback of $$\co(4)$$ over $$\CP^3$$ to $$K$$.
Therefore, the total Chern class is $$c(K) = c(\tau_{\CP^3}|_K)/c(\co(4)|_K) =
(1+x)^4/(1+4x)$$. Therefore, $$c_1(K) = 0$$ and $$c_2(K) = 6x^2$$. We conclude
that $$p_1(K) = -12x^2$$. But $$\langle x^2, [K]\rangle = 4$$, since $$K$$ is a
hypersurface of degree $$d$$, and so we find that $$\langle p_1(K), [K]\rangle =
-48$$. Finally, we get that $$\sigma(K) = -48/3 = -16$$, as desired.

Finally, we turn to this $$8$$-manifold $$L$$, which is supposed to be
$$K^2/4$$. The A-hat genus of $$L$$ is supposed to be $$1$$ (this property makes
$$L$$ a "Bott manifold"). First, note that according to [this
table](http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Spin_bordism#Generators_in_all_dimensions_as_given_by_the_classification),
we know that $$\pi_8 \MSpin$$ is generated by $$\HP^2$$ and $$L$$ (the latter of
which I'll henceforth be thinking of as $$K^2/4$$), so it suffices to construct
a spin $$8$$-manifold $$B$$ with A-hat genus $$1$$; since $$\HP^2$$ admits a
metric of positive scalar curvature, its A-hat genus vanishes (by Lichnerowicz,
although this argument is really nuking a fly; we could've alternatively proved
this by just calculation!), and so since $$\hat{A}(L) = 1$$ (by requirement), we
find that $$B$$ is cobordant to $$L + n\HP^2$$ for some integer $$n$$. This is
sufficient, since $$L = B - n\HP^2$$ in $$\pi_8 \MSpin$$.

Next, note that a $$4k$$-dimensional manifold $$M$$ being almost parallelizable
implies that it is spin, since $$w_2(M) = 0$$. It therefore suffices to find an
almost parallelizable $$8$$-manifold $$B$$ with A-hat genus $$1$$. Next, note
that since $$M^{4k}$$ is almost parallelizable, we also have $$p_n(M) = 0$$ for
$$n < k$$. Therefore, $$p_1(B) = 0$$, and so (by Hirzebruch and the
characteristic power series for the A-hat genus) the signature and the A-hat
genus of $$B$$ are $$\sigma(B) = 7\langle p_2(B), [B]\rangle/45$$ and
$$\hat{A}(B) = -4\langle p_2(B), [B]\rangle/5760 = -\langle p_2(B),
[B]\rangle/(32\times 45)$$. In particular, $$-32\hat{A}(B) = \sigma(B)/7$$. As
such, we'd like an almost parallelizable $$B^8$$ such that $$\sigma(B) =
-7\times 32$$. At this point, we turn to the classical work of Kervaire and
Milnor, where it's shown (see, e.g., the theorem on p. 91 of [this
book](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/hirzjung.pdf)) that there are
almost parallelizable $$M_0^{4k}$$ (constructed by plumbing) such that

$$\sigma(M_0^{4k}) = a_k 2^{2k+1} (2^{2k-1}-1) \cdot
\mathrm{numerator}(B_{2k}/4k),$$

where $$a_k = 1$$ if $$k$$ is even and $$2$$ if $$k$$ is odd, and the $$B_{2k}$$
are the Bernoulli numbers. If we choose $$k=2$$, then we find that there is an
$$M_0^8$$ with $$\sigma(M_0^8) = 8\times 28 = 7\times 32$$. It follows that
$$B$$ can be chosen to be $$-M_0^8$$. (If we'd like $$\sigma(B)$$ to be zero
without changing its A-hat genus, we can just add to it $$7\times 32 = 224$$
copies of $$-\HP^2$$ (since $$\hat{A}(\HP^2) = 0$$ and $$\sigma(\HP^2) = 1$$)
without changing its A-hat genus; we won't do this, although some people use
this convention.)

It doesn't really matter, but let's just note the following. First, $$\pi_8
\MSpin$$ is generated by this $$B$$ and $$\HP^2$$, and second, $$\sigma(K^2) =
16^2 = 256$$ and $$\hat{A}(K^2) = 4$$ (since $$\hat{A}(K) = -\sigma(K)/8 = 2$$).
Since $$\hat{A}(B-224\HP^2) = 1, \sigma(B-224\HP^2) = 0$$ and $$\hat{A}(\HP^2) =
0, \sigma(\HP^2) = 1$$, we have $$K^2 = 4 (B-224\HP^2) + 256 \HP^2 = 4B - 640
\HP^2$$, and therefore $$L = K^2/4$$ is $$B - 160 \HP^2$$.

OK, that was quite a lot. Let's now turn to the Witten genus. First, note that
under the map $$\pi_\ast \tmf \to \pi_\ast \ko$$ (coming from the $$\Eoo$$-ring
map $$\tmf \to \ko$$ arising via the cusp on the compactified moduli stack of
elliptic curves; see
[here](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~tlawson/papers/level3_properties.pdf)),
the element $$c_4$$ in dimension $$8$$ goes to $$\beta\in \pi_8 \ko$$ (or its
negative; I'm bad with signs). One can check fairly easily (unless I messed up
my calculation) that our manifold $$B - 224\HP^2$$ actually lives in $$\pi_8
\MString$$, and so we have a string manifold lifting $$c_4$$ (see also the
example on page 89 of [this
book](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/hirzjung.pdf), which says that
the Witten genus of our manifold is its A-hat genus times $$c_4$$; we know that
the A-hat genus of $$B - 224\HP^2$$ is indeed $$1$$). How about $$2c_6$$ (note
that $$c_6$$ is not in the image of $$\pi_{12} \tmf \to \mathrm{MF}_{12}$$)? As
explained on page 90 of the book linked to above (and the vanishing of most of
the Pontryagin numbers of almost parallelizable manifolds), it suffices to find
an almost-parallelizable $$12$$-dimensional manifold $$M^{12}$$ with
$$\sigma(M)= -2^{2\times 3+1} (2^{2\times 3-1}-1) = 2\times 3968$$, so that
$$\hat{A}(M) = 2$$, and therefore its Witten genus is $$2c_6$$. The
Kervaire-Milnor manifold again saves us: in this case, the numerator of
$$B_6/12$$ is $$1$$, and so $$\sigma(M_0^{12}) = 2\times 3968$$ (since $$a_3 =
2$$), as desired.

What about lifting $$24\Delta$$ (which is in the image of $$\pi_{24} \tmf \to
\mathrm{MF}_{24}$$)? We know this lifts to $$\pi_{24} \MString$$, since both
$$3\Delta$$ and $$8\Delta$$ lift $$3$$- and $$2$$-adically, respectively. Note
that since the Witten genus of the generator (described above) of $$\pi_{12}
\MString$$ is $$2c_6$$, there is no string $$12$$-manifold $$M$$ such that the
Witten genus of $$M^2$$ is $$c_6^2$$. I have no idea how to construct such a
$$24$$-manifold (whose Witten genus is $$24\Delta$$ or $$c_6^2$$), even though I
know it exists!

**Added later:** I guess we have a positive answer to the prize question raised
in page 86 of the book linked to above: since there is an $$M$$ with Witten
genus $$24\Delta$$, we find that the manifold $$(B - 224\HP^2)^3 - 31M$$ answers
Hirzebruch's question. Mike Hopkins already knew this; he stated the existence
of such an answer to Hirzebruch's question in his ICM address, but I guess this
actually constructs such a manifold (although, to be fair, I haven't yet
finished the task detailed in the last paragraph of [this previous
post](/algebraic-topology/2019/07/24/witten-2.html); hopefully I'll get to it
soon).

As for constructing a $$24$$-manifold with Witten genus $$24\Delta$$, I figured
that surgery theory might help. [This
paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.365.9650&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
of Browder's provides a sufficient condition for a simply connected CW-complex
$$X$$ to be homotopy equivalent to a smooth closed $$4k$$-manifold: 

* $$X$$ needs to be a $$4k$$-dimensional *Poincare complex*, i.e., there should
  exist a class $$[X]$$ such that capping with $$[X]$$ induces an isomorphism
$$\H^i(X) \to \H_{4k-i}(X)$$ (where coefficients are in any abelian group).
* There is an oriented vector bundle $$\xi$$ over $$X$$ such that there is a map
  $$f:S^n \to X^\xi$$ to the Thom space of $$\xi$$, such that $$f$$ induces an
isomorphism on top-dimensional homology.
* If $$p_i$$ are the Pontryagin classes of $$\xi$$, then the signature of the
  cup-product induced bilinear form on $$\H^{2k}(X;\RR)$$ is equal to $$\langle
L_k(p_1(\xi), \cdots, p_k(\xi)), [X]\rangle$$.

Moreover, if $$M$$ is the smooth closed $$4k$$-manifold to which $$X$$
is homotopy equivalent, then the stable normal bundle of $$M$$ is pulled back
from $$\xi$$ along this homotopy equivalence. In fact, we can avoid the use of
any surgery theory if we just want a manifold $$M$$ with a map $$g$$ to $$X$$
whose stable normal bundle is the pullback $$g^\ast \xi$$ --- surgery comes in
if we want $$g$$ to be a homotopy equivalence. To get an $$M$$ with this weaker
property, we just use the same trick appearing in the Pontryagin-Thom
construction: choose the map $$f:S^n \to X^\xi$$ so that $$f$$ is transverse to
the zero section $$X\subseteq X^\xi$$; then, $$M = f^{-1}(X)$$ is a smooth
closed $$4k$$-manifold whose stable normal bundle is $$g^\ast \xi$$ (under the
induced map $$g:M\to X$$), for which $$f_\ast([M]) = [X]$$.

Let's return to the question of lifting $$24\Delta$$. According to the above
discussion, we really only need to construct a suitable $$24$$-dimensional
Poincare complex. What properties should this Poincare complex satisfy?
According to the example beginning on page 85 of [this
document](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/hirzjung.pdf), we find
that if $$M$$ is a smooth closed oriented $$24$$-dimensional manifold with
$$p_1(M) = 0$$ and $$w_2(M) = 0$$ (i.e., $$M$$ is a string manifold), then the
Witten genus of $$M$$ is $$\hat{A}(M,\tau_M\otimes \cc) \Delta + \hat{A}(M)
(c_4^3- 744\Delta)$$, so we'd like $$\hat{A}(M) = 0$$ and $$\hat{A}(M,
\tau_M\otimes \cc) = 24$$. But $$\hat{A}(M)$$ and $$\hat{A}(M, \tau_M\otimes
\cc)$$ are defined entirely in terms of the Pontryagin classes and the
fundamental class of $$M$$, so we can just reduce to find a $$24$$-dimensional
Poincare complex whose A-hat and twisted A-hat genus satisfy the same property.
We'd like to be able to write down the A-hat and twisted A-hat genera in terms
of the Pontryagin classes; see, e.g.,
[here](http://www.math.harvard.edu/archive/272b_spring_05/handouts/A-roof/A-roof.pdf)
for an explanation of how one could do this in Mathematica. Note that since
$$p_1$$ vanishes, we have (this is $$\hat{A}_6$$ on page 3 of the linked
document)

$$\hat{A}(M^{24}) = \frac{1}{2678117105664000} (1414477 p_1^6 - 6161812 p_1^4
p_2 + 6099760 p_1^2 p_2^2 - 769728 p_2^3 + 4636288 p_1^3 p_3 \\
- 5362176 p_1 p_2 p_3 + 719872 p_3^2 - 3217728 p_1^2 p_4 + 1476352 p_2 p_4 +
  1872384 p_1 p_5 - 707584 p_6) \\
= \frac{1}{41845579776000} (11248 p_2^3 - 12027 p_3^2 + 23068 p_2 p_4 - 11056
p_6),$$

and similarly,

$$\hat{A}(M^{24}, \tau_M\otimes \cc) = \frac{1}{158505984000} (38828 p_2 p_4 -
25167 p_2^3 - 18832 p_3^2 - 4976 p_6).$$

So we have some concrete conditions necessary on our $$24$$-dimensional Poincare
complex $$X$$ and the associated $$\xi$$. How can we find such a pair
$$(X,\xi)$$?
