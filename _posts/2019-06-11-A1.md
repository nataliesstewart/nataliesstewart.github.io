One of the motivations for [this
post](/algebraic-topology/2019/03/26/thom-spectra.html) was to try to see if the
spectrum $$A_1$$ (or rather, *any of* the spectra) whose cohomology is $$A(1)$$
as a Steenrod module can be constructed in the $$C_2$$-equivariant setting. Our
group in this post will always be $$C_2$$. To explain the question in the
equivariant setting, we need to recall a few things. Recall that $$a_\sigma$$
denotes the one-point compactification of the inclusion $$\{0\} \subseteq
\sigma$$ of the fixed point of the sign representation of $$C_2$$, and that
$$u$$ is the generator of $$\H_{1-\sigma}^{C_2}(\S; \FF_2)\cong \FF_2$$. The mod
$$2$$ cohomology of a point is then $$\H^\ast_{C_2}(\S;\FF_2) = \FF_2[a_\sigma,
u] \oplus \bigoplus_{i,j} \FF_2\{w/a_\sigma^i u^j\}$$, where $$|w/a_\sigma^i
u^j| = (1+j) - (i+j)\sigma$$.

There are Steenrod operations, $$\Sq^i$$, where $$|\Sq^{2i}|$$ has degree
$$i\rho$$ and $$|\Sq^{2i+1}|$$ has degree $$i\rho+1$$. Moreover, $$\Sq^i$$ acts
trivially on $$a_\sigma$$ and $$u$$, and acts by $$\Sq^1 u = a_\sigma$$ on
$$u$$. Now, one can define a subalgebra $$A^{C_2}(1)$$ of the
$$C_2$$-equivariant Steenrod algebra as the subalgebra generated by $$\Sq^1$$
and $$\Sq^2$$. It is not hard to list out a basis:

$$A^{C_2}(1) = \FF_2\{1,\Sq^1, \Sq^2, \Sq^3, \Sq^2 \Sq^1, \Sq^3 \Sq^1, \Sq^4
\Sq^1 + \Sq^5, \Sq^5 \Sq^1\}.$$

The equivariant dual Steenrod algebra is

$$A^{C_2}_\star =
\pi_\star(\H\ul{\FF}_2)[\tau_0,\tau_1,\cdots,\xi_1,\xi_2,\cdots]/(\tau_i^2 =
\ol{u}\xi_{i+1} + a_\sigma \tau_{i+1}, i\geq 0),$$

where $$\ol{u} = u + a_\sigma \tau_0$$, $$\xi_i$$ lives in degree
$$(2^i-1)\rho$$, and $$\tau_i$$ lives in degree $$(2^i-1)\rho+1$$.

I originally wanted to construct a $$C_2$$-spectrum whose
$$\H\ul{\FF}_2$$-cohomology is $$A^{C_2}(1)$$ as a module over the
$$C_2$$-equivariant Steenrod algebra. (The extension of the action of
$$A^{C_2}(1)$$ on itself to the entire $$C_2$$-equivariant Steenrod can be done
in the same way as in the nonequivariant setting.) This, however, is not the
right question to be asking.

To understand this philosophy, consider the Moore spectrum $$\S/2$$. It is
pretty obviously realizable $$C_2$$-equivariantly, but this realization is
rather boring. The more interesting "realization" of $$\S/2$$ arises from
viewing it as the *geometric fixed points* of a $$C_2$$-spectrum, namely
$$\S/\wt{\eta}$$, where $$\wt{\eta}\in \pi_\sigma \S$$ is the
$$C_2$$-equivariant Hopf map. This map satisfies the property that its
underlying map is $$\eta$$, while upon taking geometric fixed points, it is just
multiplication by $$2$$. (Recall that the geometric fixed points $$\Phi^{C_2}
S^\sigma$$ is $$S^0$$.) One should think of $$\S/\wt{\eta}$$ as a "double" of
$$\S/2$$.

This particular story works even with the spectrum $$T(1)$$. Classically (at the
prime $$2$$), it is the Thom spectrum of a complex bundle over $$\Omega
\SU(2)$$; this space has a $$C_2$$-action (by complex conjugation), which
induces a $$C_2$$-action on $$T(1)$$; call this $$C_2$$-spectrum $$T(1)_\RR$$.
The space $$\Omega \SU(2)$$ is just $$\Omega S^{\rho+1} = \Omega^\sigma
S^{\rho+\sigma}$$ as a $$C_2$$-space. Since $$T(1)_\RR$$ is the Thom spectrum of
the $$C_2$$-equivariant map $$\Omega S^{\rho+1} \to B\GL_1(\S)$$ (trivial action
on the target) extending the map from $$S^\rho$$ detecting $$\wt{\eta}$$, we
find that $$\Phi^{C_2} T(1)_\RR$$ is the Thom spectrum of the nonequivariant map
$$\Omega S^2\to B\GL_1(\S)$$ detecting $$\Phi^{C_2} \wt{\eta} = 2$$. In other
words, the geometric fixed points $$\Phi^{C_2} T(1)_\RR$$ is equal to the
$$\E_1$$-quotient $$\S/\!\!/2$$.

From this perspective, a natural question to ask if we're trying to "realize"
(in the loosest possible sense) a finite spectrum as a $$C_2$$-spectrum is if it
admits a "doubling" (whatever that means). Then, this doubled spectrum might be
the underlying spectrum of a $$C_2$$-spectrum, and our original spectrum might
be the fixed points. What does doubling mean? One definition might be that $$Y$$
is the double of $$X$$ if the relations defined by the Steenrod action on $$X$$
agree with the relations defined by the action of the subalgebra generated by
$$\Sq^{2^i}$$ for $$i\geq 1$$ on $$Y$$. We'll give a better definition later.
Note that not every spectrum can just be doubled: the (underlying spectrum of
the) double of $$C\eta$$ is $$C\nu$$, the double of $$C\nu$$ is $$C\sigma$$, but
the double of $$C\sigma$$ does not exist (thanks to Hopf invariant one).

It so happens that in the case of $$A_1$$, doubling is indeed legal, at least
non-equivariantly. Indeed, there is a spectrum $$DA_1$$, whose cohomology is
free over the subalgebra of $$A/A \Sq^1 A$$ generated by $$\Sq^2$$ and
$$\Sq^4$$. What we'd like, therefore, is to construct a $$C_2$$-spectrum $$F$$
whose underlying is $$DA_1$$, and whose geometric fixed points $$\Phi^{C_2} F$$
is $$A_1$$.

To construct $$F$$, we notice that $$DA_1$$ splits off of the smash product of
the doubled question mark $$Q = S^0 \cup_\nu e^4 \cup_\eta e^6$$ and its
Spanier-Whitehead dual: $$Q\wedge DQ \simeq \S \vee DA_1$$. We should therefore
attempt to lift the doubled question mark complex to the $$C_2$$-equivariant
setting. There is a map $$S^{2\rho} \to \BU_\RR$$, and its composite with
$$\wt{\eta}: S^{2\rho+\sigma} \to S^{2\rho}$$ is null. Therefore, one gets a map
$$\Sigma^\rho \CP^2_\RR \to \BU_\RR$$. The Thom spectrum $$D\wt{Q}$$ of this map
is our replacement for the dual of the question mark complex $$\Sigma^3 DQ$$.
Then $$\S$$ splits off $$D\wt{Q} \wedge \wt{Q}$$; the composite of the
coevaluation and evaluation maps is the Euler characteristic of $$\wt{Q}$$,
which is $$3$$ --- an equivalence $$2$$-locally.

We finally define $$DA_1^{C_2}$$ to be the cofiber of the coevaluation map $$\S
\to D\wt{Q} \wedge \wt{Q}$$. By construction, the fixed points and underlying
desiderata hold true. I think, but haven't checked, that its cohomology is free
over the subalgebra generated by $$\Sq^2$$ and $$\Sq^4$$ of the quotient of the
$$C_2$$-equivariant Steenrod algebra by the two sided ideal generated by
$$\Sq^1$$.

What's the point? Recall (Lin's theorem) that there is a $$2$$-adic equivalence
$$\S \to \Sigma \RP^\infty_{-\infty} = \S^{tC_2}$$, so there is a spectral
sequence that runs

$$\pi_k(\S^n) \Rightarrow \pi_k(\S^{-1}).$$

Any element $$\alpha$$ of $$\pi_\ast \S$$ is represented by a coset of elements
in the $$E_2$$-page, and this coset is called the root invariant $$R(\alpha)$$
of $$\alpha$$.  An alternative description is as follows: there is a minimal
$$n$$ such that the map $$S^{|\alpha|} \to \S \to \Sigma \RP^\infty_{-n}$$, and
$$R(\alpha)$$ is the coset of lifts of $$S^{|\alpha|} \to \Sigma
\RP^\infty_{-n}$$ to the fiber $$S^{-n+1}$$ of the map $$\Sigma \RP^\infty_{-n}
\to \Sigma \RP^\infty_{-n+1}$$. One can calculate that $$R(2) = \eta$$,
$$R(\eta) = \nu$$, $$R(\nu) = \sigma$$.

The root invariant doesn't preserve multiplicative relations in any reasonable
manner (e.g., $$R(16)$$ isn't zero), so if $$X$$ is a spectrum, there isn't
necessarily another spectrum $$Y$$ with the same number of cells such that all
primary attaching maps for $$X$$ are contained in the root invariant of the
corresponding attaching maps for $$Y$$. This $$Y$$ should be thought of as the
double of $$X$$, and our philosophy on doubles shows that we should really ask
that $$Y$$ be a $$C_2$$-spectrum with $$X$$ as its geometric fixed points. ([One
way](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b498/65b76a882d925ec49d4d3735a233842e14fb.pdf)
to make the relationship between geometric fixed points and the root invariant
precise is by the following observation. Let $$\Phi^{C_2}: \pi_n^{C_2}(\S) \to
\pi_n(\S)$$ be the geometric fixed points homomorphism. Then the root invariant
$$R(\alpha)$$ of $$\alpha\in\pi_n(\S)$$ is equal to the collection of elements
in the Mahowald invariant $$\{\gamma | \beta = \gamma a_\sigma^k, \
a_\sigma^{k+1} \not | \beta, \ \beta\in (\Phi^{C_2})^{-1}(\alpha)\}$$ with
highest $$\sigma$$-degree.) What we've shown in this post is that such a $$Y$$
exists for $$A_1$$. Moreover, the style of proof suggests that the resolution of
this question for a spectrum depends very heavily on the specific spectrum, and
that proving a general such "doublability"/"deroot-ifying" result is probably
not possible.

I want to conclude this post with a cute potential application of the
construction of $$DA_1^{C_2}$$. Define a genuine $$C_2$$-spectrum $$\tmf_{C_2}$$
as follows. We use the equivalence of genuine $$C_2$$-spectra with the data of
triples $$(X,Y,f)$$ of naive $$C_2$$-spectra $$X$$, non-equivariant spectra
$$Y$$ (playing the role of geometric fixed points), and a map $$Y \to X^{tC_2}$$
to the Tate construction of $$X$$. Then $$\tmf_{C_2}$$ has underlying naive
$$C_2$$-spectrum as $$\tmf$$ with the trivial $$C_2$$-action, geometric fixed
points $$Y = \bigoplus_{k\geq 0} \Sigma^{8k} \ko$$, and $$f:Y \to X^{tC_2} =
\bigoplus_{k\in \Z} \Sigma^{8k} \ko$$ as the inclusion of the non-negatively
indexed summands.

The spectrum $$\tmf_{C_2}$$ is the height $$2$$ analogue of the $$C_2$$-spectrum
$$\ko_{C_2}$$. We [know](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.09568.pdf) that there is an
equivalence $$\ko_{C_2} \wedge C\wt{\eta} = \BP{1}_\RR$$, so it is natural to
ask if there is an equivalence $$\tmf_{C_2} \wedge DA_1^{C_2} \simeq \BP{2}_\RR
= \tmf_1(3)$$. We can obtain a map from the left hand side to the right hand
side: it is given by using the multiplication on $$\tmf_1(3)$$ and the maps
$$\tmf_{C_2} \to \tmf_1(3)$$ (obvious) and $$DA_1^{C_2} \subseteq T(2)_\RR \to
\tmf_1(3)$$, where the final map uses the universal property of $$T(2)_\RR$$ and
the Real orientability of $$\tmf_1(3)$$. Now, this map $$\tmf_{C_2} \wedge
DA_1^{C_2} \to \BP{2}_\RR$$ is an equivalence on underlying. Moreover, upon
taking geometric fixed points, we obtain a map

$$\Phi^{C_2} \tmf_{C_2} \wedge DA_1 \to \Phi^{C_2} \BP{2}_\RR = \bigoplus_{k\geq
0} \Sigma^{8k} \H\FF_2,$$

which is an equivalence since $$\ko\wedge A_1 = \H\FF_2$$. This doesn't fully
prove that the map $$\tmf_{C_2} \wedge DA_1^{C_2} \to \BP{2}_\RR$$ is an
equivalence, though: we need to show that it is an equivalence of *naive*/Borel
$$C_2$$-spectra.

We can instead regard the above discussion as providing *evidence* for our
desired equivalence. A better proof would utilize the fact, which I learnt from
Mark Behrens, that the equivariant homology of $$\tmf_{C_2}$$ [has been
computed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04547.pdf): it is
$$A^{C_2}_\star/\!\!/A^{C_2}(2)_\star$$, where

$$A^{C_2}(n)_\star =
A^{C_2}_\star/(\tau_0^{2^{n+1}},\cdots,\tau_n^2,\tau_{n+1},\cdots, \xi_1^{2^n},
\cdots,\xi_n^2,\xi_{n+1},\cdots).$$

(I think there's a typo in Definition 6.5, which writes down the profile
function for this subalgebra.) For instance, $$A^{C_2}(1)_\ast =
\pi_\star(\H\ul{\FF}_2)[\tau_0, \tau_1, \xi_1]/(\tau_0^2 + \ol{u} \xi_1 +
a_\sigma \tau_1, \tau_1^2, \xi_1^2)$$, and

$$A^{C_2}(2)_\ast = \pi_\star(\H\ul{\FF}_2)[\tau_0, \tau_1, \tau_2, \xi_1,
\xi_2]/(\tau_2^2, \xi_1^4, \xi_2^2, \tau_i^2 + \ol{u} \xi_{i+1} + a_\sigma
\tau_{i+1}, i = 0,1).$$

I believe, but haven't checked, that the homology of $$\BP{n}_\RR$$ is
$$A^{C_2}_\star/\!\!/E^{C_2}(n)_\star$$, where

$$E^{C_2}(n)_\star = A^{C_2}_\star/(\tau_{n+2}, \tau_{n+3}, \cdots, \xi_1,
\xi_2, \cdots) = \pi_\star(\H\ul{\FF}_2)[\tau_0, \cdots,
\tau_{n+1}]/(\tau_{n+1}^2 = 0, \tau_i^2 = a_\sigma \tau_{i+1}, 0\leq i\leq n).$$

Since we have an equivariant map $$\tmf_{C_2} \wedge DA_1^{C_2} \to
\BP{2}_\RR$$, to show that it's an equivalence we only need to prove the same is
true on mod $$2$$ homology. The induced map on homology goes
$$A^{C_2}_\star/\!\!/A^{C_2}(2)_\star \otimes_{\pi_\star(\H\ul{\FF}_2)}
\H_\ast(DA_1^{C_2}) \to A^{C_2}_\star/\!\!/E^{C_2}(2)_\star$$. In other words,
we need to show that $$\H_\ast(DA_1^{C_2}) =
A^{C_2}(2)_\star/\!\!/E^{C_2}(2)_\star$$. This is a consequence of the claim
that its cohomology is free over the subalgebra generated by $$\Sq^2$$ and
$$\Sq^4$$ of the quotient of the $$C_2$$-equivariant Steenrod algebra by the two
sided ideal generated by $$\Sq^1$$.
