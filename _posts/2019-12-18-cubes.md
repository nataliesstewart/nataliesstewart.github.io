Wow, I've been bad about updating this. My last post was at the beginning of the
semester, and now I'm writing this post at the end of the semester. I applied to
grad schools this past week, so maybe that explains the silence (but I think
I've just been distracted). I took a class called 18.821 this semester: it's
called project lab, and it's supposed to improve communication skills. You're
supposed to work on three projects throughout the semester, and write up a
report after three weeks. I'd like to talk about two of my contributions,
neither of which are new, but which are nonetheless fun.

In this post, I'll talk about the following question: can one write down a
parametric family of integer solutions to the equation $$x^d + y^d = z^d+ w^d$$
for $$d\geq 3$$? After running some computer searches, we (i.e., my group) were
not able to find any integer solutions for $$d\geq 5$$, so we will focus on the
cases $$d=3,4$$ in this post. 

As one would expect, the approach to finding integer solutions to the desired
equation is via finding rational points on the surface $$H_d \subseteq \PP^3$$
defined by $$x^d + y^d - z^d - w^d$$.  First, we notice that $$H_d$$ is
birationally equivalent to a pencil of curves $$\ce_d\to \PP^1$$ of degree $$d$$
if $$d$$ is odd, and of degree $$d-1$$ if $$d$$ is even, with at least two
rational points. Here's a sketch: define $$a,b,c,d$$ by the equations

$$x = a+b, \ y = c-d, \ z = a-b, \ w = c+d.$$

Then setting $$r = a/d$$, $$s = b/d$$, and $$t = c/d$$ yields an equation of
degree $$d$$ if $$d$$ is odd (and degree $$d-1$$ if $$d$$ is even) in $$r,s$$,
and $$t$$. Fixing one of these variables (the variable parametrizing the
pencil) produces an affine curve which has at least one rational point. The
second rational point is just the point at $$\infty$$.

The approach, then, is as follows: any surface of degree $$d$$ intersecting
$$d-1$$ (rational) points which lie on a line must either contain the line or
intersect the line in one other (rational) point. In order to obtain a
parametrized family of rational points on $$H_d$$, it therefore suffices to find
$$d-1$$ (resp. $$d-2$$) rational points on each fiber of $$\ce_d$$ which all lie
on the same line if $$d$$ is odd (resp. $$d$$ is even).

Let's work out the case $$d=3$$. The surface $$H_3$$ is birationally equivalent
to a pencil of elliptic curves $$\ce_3\to \PP^1$$. Using the variables
introduced above, one finds that $$H_3$$ is isomorphic to the surface in
$$\PP^3$$ defined by the equation

$$b(b^2 + 3a^2) = d(d^2 + 3c^2).$$

In terms of $$r$$, $$s$$, and $$t$$, this becomes

$$3t^2 +1 = s(3r^2 + s^2).$$

By varying $$r$$, we obtain the desired pencil $$\ce_3 \to \PP^1$$ of elliptic
curves; the fiber $$(\ce_3)_r$$ has a rational point $$P_r = (s,t) = (1,r)$$ (or,
homogenizing, the point $$[1:r:1]$$). This implies that $$\ce_3$$ is a pencil of
elliptic curves, so the tangent line to $$P_r$$ on $$(\ce_3)_r$$ must intersect
$$(\ce_3)_r$$ at another (necessarily rational, by the rational roots theorem)
point.

The tangent line $$\ell$$ to a point $$(s_0, t_0)$$ on $$(\ce_3)_r$$ has slope
$$m = (r^2 + s_0^2)/2t_0$$, so the line tangent to it is given by $$T =
m(S-s_0) + t_0.$$ Substituting, we find that the other point $$(s_1, t_1)$$ at
which $$\ell$$ intersects $$(\ce_3)_r$$ must solve

$$s^3 - 3m^2 s^2 + 3(r^2 - 2m(t_0-ms_0)) s - 3(t_0-ms_0)^2 - 1 = 0.$$

The sum of the roots must be the negative of the coefficient of $$s^2$$, which
is $$-3m^2$$; therefore,

$$s_1 = 3m^2 - 2s_0, \ t_1 = m(s_1 - s_0) + t_0.$$

For the point $$P_s$$, where $$s_0 = 1$$ and $$t_0 = r$$, the slope $$m$$ is
$$(r^2 + 1)/2r$$, so the other rational point obtained is

$$Q_r = [s(r): t(r): 1] = \left[\frac{2r(3r^4 - 2r^2 + 3)}{8r^3}: \frac{3r^6 +
5r^4 - 3r^2 + 3}{8r^3} : 1\right].$$

Since $$r = a/d$$, $$s = b/d$$, and $$t = c/d$$, it makes sense to set $$d =
8r^3$$ to obtain

$$a = dr = 8r^4, \ b = ds = 2r(3r^4 - 2r^2 + 3), \ c = dt = 3r^6 + 5r^4 - 3r^2 +
3, \ d = 8r^3.$$

Therefore, for each $$r\in \Z$$, the integers

$$x = 2(3r^5 + 4r^4 - 2r^3 + 3r), \ y = 3r^6 + 5r^4 - 8r^3 - 3r^2 + 3, \\
z = 2(4r^4 + 2r^3 - 3r - 3r^5), \ w = 3r^6 + 5r^4 + 8r^3 - 3r^2 + 3$$

define integral points on $$H_3$$. These equations define a section $$\PP^1
-\!\!\to \ce_3$$ of the pencil $$\ce_3\to \PP^1$$.

OK, now let's move on to $$d=4$$. Our analysis of the surface $$H_4$$ follows
the same general procedure as for $$H_3$$. The surface $$H_4$$ is birationally
equivalent to a pencil of elliptic curves $$\ce_4\to \PP^1$$. Using the
variables introduced above, one finds that $$H_4$$ is isomorphic to the surface
in $$\PP^3$$ defined by the equation

$$ab(a^2 - b^2) = cd(c^2 - d^2),$$

which, in terms of $$r$$, $$s$$, and $$t$$, becomes

$$t(t^2 + 1) = rs(r^2 + s^2).$$

Varying $$s$$ provides the desired pencil $$\ce_4 \to \PP^1$$ of elliptic
curves; the fiber $$(\ce_4)_s$$ has a rational point $$P_s = (t,r) = (s,1)$$
(or, homogenizing, the point $$[s:1:1]$$).

The line connecting $$P_s$$ with $$\infty$$ must intersect $$(\ce_4)_s$$ in one
other point (which is necessarily a rational point by the rational roots
theorem). The asymptote of $$(\ce_4)_s$$ is given by $$t = rs^{1/3}$$, so the
line between $$P_s$$ and $$\infty$$ may be parametrized as $$T = s^{1/3}(R-1) +
s.$$ Solving for the third point of intersection shows that it is

$$Q_s = [t(s):r(s):1] = \left[T(r(s)), \frac{1 + (s -
s^{1/3})^2}{3s^{2/3}}:1\right] = \left[\frac{s^2 + s^{4/3} - 2s^{2/3} +
1}{3s^{1/3}}, \frac{s^2 + s^{2/3} - 2s^{4/3} + 1}{3s^{2/3}}:1\right].$$

For every $$k\in \Z$$, we will now consider the fiber $$(\ce_4)_s$$ over $$s =
k^3$$.  The expression for $$Q_s$$ suggests choosing $$d = 3k^2 = 3s^{2/3}$$,
so that

$$a = dr = k^6 + k^2 - 2k^4 + 1, \ b = ds = 3k^5, \ c = dt = k^7 + k^5 - 2k^3 +
k, \ d = 3k^2.$$

As before, the following result is now an immediate consequence: for each
$$r\in \Z$$, the integers

$$x = r^6 + 3r^5 - 2r^4 + r^2 + 1, \ y = r^7 + r^5 - 2r^3 - 3r^2 + r, \\
z = r^6 - 3r^5 - 2r^4 + r^2 + 1, \ w = r^7 + r^5 - 2r^3 + 3r^2 + r$$

define integral points on $$H_4$$. These equations define a section $$\PP^1
-\!\!\to \ce_4$$ of the pencil $$\ce_4\to \PP^1$$.

All in all, this is pretty nice: for $$d=3,4$$, we've obtained a parametric
family of solutions. Something nice happens in characteristic $$p$$ in the
function field setting: the surface $$H_{p+1}$$ is unirational over $$\FF_q(t)$$
(and in particular, has a rational family of $$\FF_q(t)$$-rational points), as
we shall now demonstrate.

The linearity of Frobenius (i.e., the $$q$$th power map) in characteristic $$p$$
implies that $$H_d$$ has a rational point if and only if $$H_{d/\gcd(p,d)}$$
does, so we can and will assume that $$d$$ is relatively prime to $$p$$. Note
that the Jacobian criterion then implies that $$H_d$$ is smooth. (Note that by
Chevalley-Warning, the surface $$H_d$$ contains at least one $$\FF_q$$-rational
point if $$d\leq 4$$, and in this case $$p$$ divides $$|H_d(\FF_q)|$$.)

An $$\FF_q(t)$$-point of $$H_d$$ is equivalently a rational map $$\PP^1_{\FF_q}
-\!\!\to H_d$$, so one possible approach to finding (both $$\FF_q$$- and
$$\FF_q(t)$$-) rational points on $$H_d$$ is to understand lines on $$H_d$$.
Indeed, if a surface in $$\PP^3$$ has $$n$$ lines, then a generic hyperplane
section has $$n$$ rational points.

Here's an example. The surface $$H_3$$ is a cubic surface, so the classical
result that there are $$27$$ lines on a cubic surface gives at least
$$3\gcd(3,q-1)^2$$ distinct $$\FF_q(t)$$-rational points on $$H_3$$ for any
finite field $$\FF_q$$ of order $$q$$ with $$p\neq 3$$.  (Over an algebraically
closed of characteristic $$0$$, there are $$27$$ lines.)
    
We can be explicit about these solutions: every line in $$\PP^3$$ is given by
equations of the form $$x = az + bw$$ and $$y = cz + dw$$ for some $$a,b,c,d\in
k$$. Then,

$$z^3 + w^3 = (a^3 + c^3) z^3 + 3(a^2 b + c^2 d) z^2 w + 3(ab^2 + cd^2) zw^2 +
(b^3 + d^3) w^3.$$

By assumption, the characteristic of $$k$$ is not $$3$$, so we need to solve
    
$$a^3 + c^3 = 1 = b^3 + d^3, \ a^2 b = -c^2 d, \ ab^2 = -cd^2.$$

If all of $$a,b,c,d$$ are nonzero, then this implies that $$-a^3 = c^3$$, which
is impossible by the first equation. Therefore, at least one of $$a,b,c,d$$ must
vanish. Without loss of generality, if $$a=0$$, then $$c^3 = 1$$, $$d=0$$, and
$$b^3 = 1$$. There are $$\gcd(3,p^f-1)$$ primitive third roots of unity in
$$\FF_{p^f}$$. By setting $$c = \omega^i$$ and $$b = \omega^j$$ (with $$0\leq
i,j\leq 2$$), we obtain $$\gcd(3,q-1)^2$$ lines on $$H_3$$ --- permuting
coordinates gives the desired $$3\gcd(3,q-1)^2$$ lines. Explicitly, these lines
are given by 

$$x - y\omega^i = 0 = w - z\omega^j, \ x - z\omega^i = 0 = w - y\omega^j, \ x -
w\omega^i = 0 = x - y\omega^j,$$

for $$0\leq i,j\leq 2$$.

More generally, we have the following: if $$d\geq 3$$ is odd and $$p$$ does not
divide $$d$$, then the surface $$H_d$$ has at least $$3\gcd(d,q-1)^2$$ lines
over a finite field $$\FF_q$$ of order $$q$$. (Over an algebraically closed of
characteristic zero, there are $$3d^2$$ lines.) Motivated by the example of
$$d=3$$ given above, we note that $$3\gcd(d, q-1)^2$$ lines on $$H_d$$ (for
general $$d$$) are given by

$$x - y\zeta^i = 0 = w - z\zeta^j, \ x - z\zeta^i = 0 = w - y\zeta^j, \ x -
w\zeta^i = 0 = x - y\zeta^j,$$

where $$\zeta^d = -1$$ (there are $$\gcd(d, q-1)$$ such elements in $$\FF_q$$,
given by the negatives of $$d$$th roots of unity in $$\FF_q$$), and $$0\leq
i,j\leq d-1$$.

A parametrized family of $$\FF_q(t)$$-rational points on $$H_d$$ is the same
data as a rational map $$\PP^1_{\FF_q}\times \PP^1_{\FF_q}-\!\!\to H_d$$. Since
$$\PP^1_{\FF_q}\times \PP^1_{\FF_q}$$ is birational to $$\PP^2_{\FF_q}$$, it
suffices to construct a nontrivial rational map $$F:\PP^2_{\FF_q}-\!\!\to H_d$$.
Such a map certainly exists if $$H_d$$ is unirational (although this is a much
stronger condition, since it says that $$F$$ is surjective).

For instance, the cubic surface $$H_3$$ is smooth (if $$p\neq 3$$), so it is
isomorphic to the blowup of $$\PP^2$$ at six points. It follows that $$H_3$$ is
rational (i.e., birationally equivalent to $$\PP^2$$), so there does indeed
exist a rational family of $$\FF_q(t)$$-rational points on $$H_3$$. In fact, the
family of integral points on $$H_3$$ discussed above provides an example of a
parametrized family of $$\FF_q(t)$$-rational points on $$H_3$$. Note that we
similarly have a parametrized family of $$\FF_q(t)$$-rational points on $$H_4$$,
and hence defines a rational map $$\PP^2_{\FF_q} -\!\!\to H_4$$.

None of this was special to characteristic $$p$$. But the following example
displays phenomena that are unique to working in characteristic $$p$$. Consider
the degree $$p+1$$ surface $$H_{p+1}$$, where $$p$$ is an odd prime. Motivated
by the above discussion, we will try to adopt the methods from the first part of
this post. Let us use the notation established in the first part; then the
equation defining $$H_{p+1}$$ translates to

$$ab(a^{p-1} + b^{p-1}) = cd(c^{p-1} + d^{p-1}),$$

which, in terms of $$r,s$$, and $$t$$ translates to
    
$$t(t^{p-1} + 1) = r^p s + r s^p.$$

If $$s = u^p$$, then this becomes
   
$$(t - ru)^p = r u^{p^2} - t.$$

It follows that the function field $$\FF_q(H_{p+1})$$ is contained in
$$\FF_q(t,r,u) = \FF_q(t-ru, u) = \FF_q(\PP^2)$$. This defines a rational map
$$\PP^2_{\FF_q} -\!\!\to H_{p+1}$$, which implies that there is a rational
family of $$\FF_q(t)$$-rational points on $$H_{p+1}$$. If $$d$$ divides $$p+1$$,
then the map $$H_d \to H_{p+1}$$ given by sending $$[x:y:z:w]$$ to
$$[x^{(p+1)/d}: y^{(p+1)/d}: z^{(p+1)/d}: w^{(p+1)/d}]$$ is a surjective
morphism, so $$H_d$$ also admits a rational family of $$\FF_q(t)$$-rational
points in this case.  (In fact, this argument proves the stronger claim that
$$H_d$$ is unirational if $$d$$ divides $$p+1$$.). We do not know if $$H_d$$ is
rational (i.e., birationally equivalent to $$\PP^2_{\FF_q}$$).
