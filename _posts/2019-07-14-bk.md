It's been a while! In this post, I'd like to contemplate a sort of
generalization of Arone's result, which we discussed in our [last
post](/algebraic-topology/2019/07/02/goodwillie.html). There, we said that if
$$F_m(X)$$ is the functor obtained by taking the fiber of the "iterated double
suspension" $$F_{m-1}(X) \to \Omega^{2m} F_{m-1}(\Sigma^2 X)$$, then $$\Phi_N
F_m(X) = 0$$ for $$p^N < m$$, and the map $$F_m(X) \to P_{p^n} F_m(X)$$ is an
equivalence (for $$X$$ an odd sphere) after applying $$\Phi_n$$, where $$n =
v_p(m)+1$$. Moreover, $$F_m(X)$$ itself had a self-map $$F_m(X) \to
\Omega^{2m+2} F_m(\Sigma^2 X)$$. This is strongly suggestive of thinking of
$$F_m$$ as a "type $$n$$ functor". In this post, I'd like to develop this
analogy further.

To begin, we need to recall a few definitions. Let $$\cJ$$ denote the nerve of
the topological category of finite-dimensional complex vector spaces with a
Hermitian inner product, and morphisms being linear isometries. Let $$\cJ_n$$
denote the same category, except where the mapping space $$\Map_{\cJ_n}(V,W)$$
is the Thom space of the bundle over $$\Map_\cJ(V,W)$$ whose fiber over $$f:V\to
W$$ is $$n(W-f(V))$$, where $$W-f(V)$$ denotes the orthogonal complement of
$$f(V)$$ in $$W$$. If $$\cC$$ is any pointed category, let $$\cJ_n(\cC)$$ denote
the functor category $$\Fun_\ast(\cJ_n, \cC)$$, and let $$\Top_\ast^\cC$$ denote
$$\Fun_\ast(\cC, \Top_\ast)$$.

Let $$\cC$$ now be any category. There are inclusions $$\cJ_0\subseteq \cJ_1
\subseteq \cdots$$, and this gives a restriction functor
$$\Res^n_{n-1}:\cJ_n(\Top_\ast^\cC) \to \cJ_{n-1}(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$. This functor
admits a right adjoint $$\Ind^n_{n-1}:\cJ_{n-1}(\Top_\ast^\cC) \to
\cJ_n(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$; let $$\Ind^n_m = \Ind^n_{n-1} \cdots \Ind^{m+1}_m$$.
Define the $$n$$th derivative $$F^{(n)}$$ of $$F\in \cJ_0(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$ to be
the object $$\Ind^n_0 F\in \cJ_n(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$. We shall abusively identify
this with $$\Res^n_0 \Ind^n_0 F\in \cJ_0(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$; this functor admits
an explicit description. First note that

$$\Res^n_0 \Ind^n_0 = \Res^1_0 \cdots \Res^n_{n-1} \Ind^n_{n-1} \cdots
\Ind^1_0,$$

so it suffices to describe $$\Res^n_{n-1} \Ind^n_{n-1}$$ for all $$n$$.

To obtain this explicit description, let $$F\in \cJ_n(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$ be a
pointed functor; then, the composition map $$\Map_{\cJ_n}(W, V\oplus W) \otimes
F(W)\to F(V\oplus W)$$ gives a map $$S^{nV} \otimes F(W) \to F(V\oplus W)$$,
i.e., a natural transformation $$F(W) \to \Omega^{nV} F(V\oplus W)$$. When $$V =
\cc$$, we will denote this map by $$w_n$$. The fiber of $$w_n$$ is the functor
$$\Res^{n+1}_n \Ind^{n+1}_n F$$.

What's the intuition supposed to be? We will mostly be fixing the category
$$\cC$$ to be the category of pointed spaces. We will always denote objects
$$F\in \cJ_n(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$ as $$F(V,W)$$, where $$V\in \cJ_n$$ and $$W\in
\cC$$. In this case, we have an object $$\cf\in \cJ_0(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$ given by
$$\cf(V):\cC\to \Top_\ast$$, sending $$W\in \cC$$ to $$\Omega^V \Sigma^V S(W)$$,
the unit sphere. We will mostly be thinking of objects of $$\cC$$ not as complex
vector spaces, but rather as the associated unit spheres. (Note that
$$\Top_\ast^\cC$$ is equivalent to the category of spectra $$\Sp$$.) The $$n$$th
derivative $$\cf^{(n)}$$ (or, more precisely, $$\Res^n_0 \cf^{(n)}\in
\cJ_0(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$) is then related to Weiss' functors $$F_n$$ that we
discussed [last time](/algebraic-topology/2019/07/02/goodwillie.html) via
$$F^{(n)}(\cc^0,W) = F_{n-1}(S(W_\cc))$$.

From now on, fix a prime $$p$$, and $$p$$-localize all spaces and spectra. The
functors $$\cf^{(n)}\in \cJ_n(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$ then satisfies some important
finiteness conditions for any fixed $$V\in \cJ_n$$:
* The Goodwillie tower of $$\cf^{(n)}(V)$$ converges on odd spheres, and it does
  so exponentially quickly (i.e., $$D_d \cf^{(n)}(V)$$ is contractible on odd
spheres for $$d$$ not a power of $$p$$);
* The spectrum $$\Phi_d D_{p^k} \cf^{(n)}(V)$$ is trivial on odd spheres for
  $$d<k$$; and
* $$D_m \cf^{(n)}(V)$$ is trivial on odd spheres if $$m < n$$.

Let $$\cd_n$$ denote the full subcategory of $$\cJ_n(\Top_\ast^\cC)$$ consisting
of functors satisfying the first two conditions, and let $$\wt{\cd}_n$$ denote
the subcategory of $$\cd_n$$ consisting of functors satisfying all three
conditions; note that only the third property imposes some interaction between
the $$n$$ in $$\cJ_n$$ and the value of the functor on odd-dimensional spheres.
Let $$F\in \cd_n$$; the second condition implies that for any $$V\in \cJ_n$$,
the map $$F(V)\to P_{p^j} F(V)$$ is a $$\Phi_d$$-equivalence for all $$d\leq
j$$. Moreover, if $$F\in \wt{\cd}_n$$, and $$d$$ is such that $$p^{d-1} < n \leq
p^d$$, then the third condition implies that $$P_{p^d-1} F(V)$$ is trivial, and
so $$\Phi_d F(V) \xrightarrow{\sim} \Phi_d P_{p^d} F(V) = L_{K(d)} \DD_{p^d}
F(V)$$ (where $$\DD_{p^d} F(V)$$ is the spectrum whose zeroth space is the
$$p^d$$-th Goodwillie layer). As we mentioned in the previous post, this
generalizes results of Mahowald and Mahowald-Thompson.

Arone's results show that if we view $$\cf^{(n)}\in \wt{\cd}_n$$, then
$$\Ind^{n+1}_n \cf^{(n)} = \cf^{(n+1)}$$ is also in $$\wt{\cd}_{n+1}$$. The
proof that $$\cf^{(n+1)}$$ satisfies the first property is obvious. For the
second property, Arone proves that the cohomology of $$D_{p^k} \cf^{(n)}(V,W)$$
for any $$W\in \cC$$ is free over $$A(k-1)$$, so $$\Phi_d$$ kills it for any $$d
< k$$. (Together, these show that $$\cf^{(n+1)}\in \cd_{n+1}$$.) The third
property (which shows that $$\cf^{(n+1)}\in \wt{\cd}_{n+1}$$) is the claim that
$$D_n w_n: D_n \cf^{(n)}(V) \to D_n \Omega^{n\cc} \cf^{(n)}(V\oplus \cc)$$ is an
equivalence.

We would like to say that something similar is true for any $$F\in \wt{\cd}_n$$;
namely, $$\Ind^{n+1}_n F\in \wt{\cd}_{n+1}$$. First, note that $$\Ind^{n+1}_n
F\in \cd_{n+1}$$: indeed, the convergence of the Goodwillie tower is immediate;
the vanishing of $$\Phi_d D_{p^k} \Ind^{n+1}_n F(V)$$ for $$d < k$$ follows
immediately from the five lemma and the existence of the fiber sequence

$$\Res^{n+1}_n \Ind^{n+1}_n F(V) \to F(V) \xrightarrow{w_n} \Omega^{n\cc}
F(V\oplus \cc)$$

combined with the fact that $$\Res^{n+1}_n \Ind^{n+1}_n F(V)$$ and
$$\Ind^{n+1}_n F(V)$$ represent the same functor $$\cC\to \Top_\ast$$.

We are left with showing the third condition, namely that $$D_m \Ind^{n+1}_n
F(V)$$ is trivial for $$m < n+1$$. By the five lemma and the fiber sequence
referred to above, we know that $$D_m \Ind^{n+1}_n F(V)$$ vanishes for $$m <
n$$; to conclude, we need $$D_n w_n$$ to be an equivalence. But there is no
reason for this to be true in general! Note, however, that if $$F\to G\to H$$ is
a fiber sequence in $$\cd_n$$, and $$D_n w_n$$ is an equivalence for $$F(V)$$
and $$H(V)$$ and all $$V$$, then it is also an equivalence for $$G(V)$$ and all
$$V$$. In particular, we find, using Arone's observation that $$D_n w_n$$ is an
equivalence for $$\cf^{(n)}$$ (which really just boils down to Weiss'
calculation of $$D_m \cf^{(n)}$$), that $$D_n w_n$$ is an equivalence for any
$$F\in \wt{\cd}_n$$ built from $$\cf^{(n)}$$ by the two-out-of-three property
for fiber sequences and retractions (note that $$\wt{\cd}_n$$ is itself closed
under the two-out-of-three property for fiber sequences and retractions).

This is looking suspiciously like it's calling out for an unstable version of
the thick subcategory theorem. The analogy, I guess, is supposed to be that
[Arone-Mahowald](http://hopf.math.purdue.edu/Arone-Mahowald/ArMahowald.pdf) and
[Arone](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b6d/b29d723424fc72d494a19d6c952c77eb276c.pdf)
proved unstable analogues of the *existence* of type $$n$$ spectra (the
$$\cf^{(p^k)}$$ are supposed to be analogues of Mitchell's complexes with
$$A(k-1)$$-free homology), and that Weiss calculus produces unstable analogues
(namely, the maps we've been denoting $$w_n$$) of self-maps. (I have no idea
what the appropriate analogue of the nilpotence theorem should be.) In any case,
the final sentence of the previous paragraph seemed to be placing some sort of
special role on the functors $$\cf^{(n)}$$, but there is no *a priori* reason
for them to be distinguished.  This motivates the following conjecture.

**Conjecture:** Let $$\ce_{\geq n}$$ denote the subcategory of
$$\wt{\cd}_{p^n}$$ consisting of "finite" functors $$F$$ (i.e., those for which
$$\Res^n_0 F$$ is constructed from $$\cf$$ via the two-out-of-three property for
fiber sequences and retractions), and let $$\ce_n$$ denote the subcategory of
$$\ce_{\geq n}$$ consisting of those functors for which $$D_{p^n} F(V)$$ is
nontrivial. Let $$\cT$$ denote any subcategory of $$\ce_{\geq n}$$ that is
closed under the two-out-of-three property for fiber sequences and retractions,
and assume that $$\cT$$ contains an object of $$\ce_n$$. Then $$\ce_{\geq n}
\subseteq \cT$$.

It would follow from this conjecture that any "finite" $$F\in \wt{\cd}_{p^n}$$
is in the subcategory of $$\wt{\cd}_{p^n}$$ generated by $$\cf^{(n)}$$, so we
have $$\Ind^{p^{n+1}}_{p^n} F\in \wt{\cd}_{p^{n+1}}$$. Since the maps $$w_n$$
are supposed to be analogues of the $$v_d$$-self maps, this gives an unstable
analogue of the 1980's style Hopkins-Devinatz-Smith-Ravenel results.

Let us now consider how one might approach the conjecture. We know that
$$\ce_{\geq n} \subseteq \cJ_{p^n}(\Top_\ast^\cC) \simeq \Fun_\ast(\cC,
\Top_\ast^{\cJ_{p^n}})$$. Now, for any $$F\in \Top_\ast^{\cJ_{p^n}}$$ (obtained
as the value of a functor $$F\in \ce_{\geq n}$$ for some fixed object of
$$\cC$$), the map $$w_{p^n}: F(V) \to \Omega^{p^n\cc} F(V\oplus \cc)$$ for a
fixed $$V\in \cJ_{p^n}$$ gives maps

$$F(V) \xrightarrow{w_{p^n}} \Omega^{p^n\cc} F(V\oplus \cc)
\xrightarrow{w_{p^n}} \Omega^{2p^n\cc} F(V\oplus \cc^2) \to \cdots \to
D_{p^n} F(V) = \Omega^\infty \DD_{p^n} F(V),$$

where the final term in the sequence is the mapping telescope. By assumption,
$$\DD_{p^n} F(V)$$ is a finite spectrum. The statement that $$D_{p^n} F(V)$$ is
nontrivial (i.e., that $$F\in \ce_n$$) implies that $$\DD_{p^n} F(V)$$ is not
$$K(n)$$-acyclic (but it is $$K(n-1)$$-acyclic by virtue of $$F$$ being in
$$\wt{\cd}_{p^n}$$), so it is of type $$n$$. One can see that this procedure in
fact defines a functor $$\ce_{\geq n} \to \Fun_\ast(\cC,
\cJ_{p^n}(\Sp^\omega_{\geq n}))$$. I'd like to better understand
$$\Fun_\ast(\cC, \cJ_{p^n}(\Sp^\omega_{\geq n}))$$ and its relation to
$$\ce_{\geq n}$$.

If these two categories are equivalent (which they are not), then the conjecture
would be implied by the stable thick subcategory theorem (and therefore be
true). I'm not sure how convinced I am about the conjecture, though; I think
it's false, because delooping is not a procedure which can be iterated in
general. In any case, I'll return to this topic in a future post.
