The Rezk logarithm defines a map $$\ell_n:\gl_1(R) \to \Lk R$$; [Rezk
gave](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407022) a formula for $$\ell_n$$ in the case
of $$R$$ being a height $$n$$ Morava $$E$$-theory. He also gave a general
formula for $$\ell_1$$ when $$R$$ is any $$K(1)$$-local $$\Eoo$$-ring. In this
post, we will study the effect of this map when $$R$$ is chosen to be the
sphere spectrum.

Trying to study $$\alpha_1$$ via the logarithm, however, will lead to a dead
end: at $$p=3$$, the image of $$\alpha_1 \in \pi_3 \gl_1(\S)$$ is zero under
the $$K(1)$$-local logarithm $$\ell_1:\gl_1(\S) \to \Lone \S$$. To see this, we
will $$3$$-localize implicitly. There is a commutative diagram of $$\pi_\ast
\S$$-modules, coming from the analogous square of spectra:

<img style="display: block; margin: auto;" height="37.5%" width="37.5%"
alt="photo" src="/assets/log-square.png">

The image of $$\alpha_1$$ under each of the left vertical maps is nonzero, and
the element $$\alpha_1$$ is detected in both $$\pi_\ast \Lone \S$$ and
$$\pi_\ast E_2^{hC_3}$$. Moreover, the top two vertical maps are injective in
low degrees (in particular, in degree $$3$$). We will compute $$\ell_2$$ on
$$\pi_3 \gl_1 E_2^{hC_3}$$; in fact: the map $$\ell_2:\pi_3 \gl_1 \tmf \to
\pi_3 E_2^{hC_3}$$ is zero on the element $$\alpha_1$$.

Let us prove this statement. The map $$\ell_2$$ induces a map of homotopy fixed
point spectral sequences:

<img style="display: block; margin: auto;" height="50%" width="50%" alt="photo"
src="/assets/hfpss-square.png">

where the vertical maps come from the composite $$\Tmf(2)^{h\GL_2(\FF_2)}
\to \Tmf(2)^{hC_3} \to E_2^{hC_3}$$ of $$\Eoo$$-ring morphisms. Since
$$\alpha_1$$ has Adams-Novikov filtration $$1$$, it is represented by an
element of $$\H^1(\GL_2(\FF_2); \pi_4 \gl_1 \tmf(2))$$, so we need to
understand $$\ell_2$$ on $$\pi_4 \gl_1 \tmf(2)$$. There is an additive
equivalence $$\tmf(2) = \BP{2} \vee \Sigma^4 \BP{2} \vee \Sigma^8 \BP{2}
\vee \Sigma^{12} \BP{2}$$, so $$\pi_4 \gl_1 \tmf(2) = \Z_3\{v_1\} \oplus
\Z_3\{1\}$$.

Now, $$\pi_\ast \tmf(2) = \Z_3[\lambda_1, \lambda_2]$$, with $$|\lambda_i| =
4$$, and the element $$\lambda_1$$, not $$\lambda_2$$, is in the image of the
map $$\Z_3\{\lambda_1\} \cong \pi_4 \tmf_1(2) \to \pi_4 \tmf(2)$$. The
element of $$\pi_4 \tmf_1(2)$$ detects the fact that $$\alpha_1$$ is null in
$$\tmf_1(2)$$, hence also that it is null in $$\tmf(2)$$. This means (and this
statement needs to be fleshed out) that we only need to understand $$\ell_2$$
on $$\pi_4 \gl_1 \tmf_1(2)$$, and not on the whole of $$\pi_4 \gl_1 \tmf(2)$$.
The claim reduces to proving that it is zero in this degree.

There is an injection $$\pi_4 \gl_1 \tmf_1(2) \to \pi_4 \gl_1 E_2$$. (Note that
$$\tmf_1(2) = \BP{2} \vee \Sigma^8 \BP{2}$$.) By Example 4.9
[here](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~mando/papers/koandtmf.pdf), we know
that the effect of $$\ell_2$$ on $$\pi_{2k}$$ is

$$\ell_2(1+x) = (1-T_3+3^{k-1})x.$$

We therefore need to understand the effect of $$T_3$$ on $$\pi_4 \tmf_1(2)
\cong \H^0(M_{\Gamma_1(2)}; \omega^{\otimes 2})$$. This ring is precisely
the ring of $$\Gamma_1(2)$$-modular forms over $$\Z_3$$. This ring is
torsion-free and of rank one, so we can choose a generator of this ring
after rationalizing; in this case, the normalized Eisenstein series

$$G_{2,2}(z) = G_2(z) - 2G_2(2z) = 1+24\sum^\infty_{n=1}\left(\sum_{0< d|n,\
d\text{ odd}} d\right) q^n$$

is a generator of the $$\QQ$$-vector space of weight $$2$$ modular forms for
$$\Gamma_1(2)$$. Moreover, if $$G_{2,N}(z) = G_2(z) - NG_2(Nz)$$, so that
$$G_{2,N}\in M_2(\Gamma_0(N))$$, then the Hecke operator $$T_m$$ acts on
$$G_{2,N}$$ by multiplication by $$\sigma_1(m)$$ if $$\gcd(m,N) = 1$$. In
particular, $$T_3$$ acts on $$G_{2,2}$$ by multiplication by $$\sigma_1(3) =
4$$.  It follows that

$$\ell_2(1+\lambda_1) = (1-T_3+3^{2-1})\lambda_1 = 0,$$

as desired.

It follows from the lemma that $$\ell_2 = (1-U_3)\ell_1:\pi_3 \gl_1 E_2^{hC_3}
\to \pi_3 \Lone E_2^{hC_3}$$ is zero on $$\alpha_1$$. To conclude that
$$\ell_1:\gl_1(\S) \to \Lone \S$$ sends $$\alpha_1$$ to zero, we need to show
that $$1-U_3$$ is injective on weight $$2$$ modular forms for $$\Gamma_1(2)$$.
It suffices to show that $$1-U_3$$ is nonzero on the generator $$G_{2,2}$$, and
to do so, it suffices to do so for $$\QQ$$-modular forms. This follows from a
direct computation: one finds that

$$(1-U_3) G_{2,2} = 72q + \cdots$$

Note that the composite

$$\pi_3 \gl_1(\S) \to \pi_3 \gl_1(\Ltwo \S) \to \pi_3 \Ltwo \S \to \pi_3
E_2^{hC_3}$$

is zero by the above argument. I don't know this, but I would suspect that the
last map sends $$\alpha_1$$ to a nonzero element, so that the map
$$\ell_2:\gl_1(\S) \to \Ltwo \S$$ would also send $$\alpha_1$$ to zero.

The statement that $$\alpha_1$$ is not detected by the logarithm is not
unexpected, since the image of $$\eta\in \pi_1 \gl_1(\S)$$ is zero under the
$$K(1)$$-local logarithm $$\ell_1$$ (note that we have fixed $$p=2$$). The
argument is the same as above, except with $$\tmf$$ replaced by $$\ko$$. As
before, it suffices to show that $$\ell_1$$ is already zero on $$\pi_2 \gl_1
\ku$$. This computation can be done explicitly using Rezk's formula for the
$$K(1)$$-local logarithm. There is an isomorphism $$\pi_{2n} \gl_1 \ku \cong
1+\epsilon \pi_{2n}\ku$$, where $$1-\epsilon$$ is the class in
$$\ku^0(S^{2n})$$ represented by the tangent bundle of $$S^{2n}$$. Recall that
Rezk's formula states that 

$$\ell_1(x) = -\frac{1}{p} \log\left(\frac{\psi^p(x)}{x^p}\right),$$

so we need to understand $$\psi^p(\epsilon)$$. Let $$f:(S^2)^n\to S^{2n}$$
denote the quotient map; then, if $$L_i$$ is the canonical line bundle
$$\co(1)$$ on the $$i$$th copy of $$S^2 = \CP^1$$, we have $$f^\ast \epsilon =
\prod_{1\leq i\leq n} (1-L_i)$$. Since

$$\psi^p(1-L_i) = 1 - L_i^p = 1-(1-(1-L_i))^p = 1-(1-p(1-L_i)) =
p(1-L_i),$$

since $$1-L_i$$ squares to zero. It follows that $$\psi^p(\epsilon) =
p^n\epsilon$$, and therefore $$\psi^p(1+\epsilon) = 1+p^n\epsilon$$. In
particular,

$$\ell_1(1+k\epsilon) =
-\frac{1}{p}\log\left(\frac{1+p^nk\epsilon}{(1+k\epsilon)^p}\right) \equiv
-\frac{1}{p}\log(1+p(p^{n-1}-1)k\epsilon)\pmod{p}.$$

If $$n>0$$, this is precisely multiplication by $$1-p^{n-1}$$ modulo $$p$$. If
$$n=1$$, therefore, it is zero, so $$\ell_1$$ is zero on $$\pi_2 \gl_1 \ku$$.

These two propositions suggest a natural conjecture:

**Conjecture:** The map $$\ell_n:\gl_1 \S^\wedge_p \to L_{K(n)} \S$$ sends
$$\alpha_1$$ to zero for all $$n$$ and any prime $$p$$. (At the very least,
this should be true for $$n=1$$; moreover, the composite $$\gl_1 \S^\wedge_p
\to L_{K(p-1)} \S \to E_{p-1}^{hC_p}$$ should send $$\alpha_1$$ to zero.)

We note, also, that $$\ell_2(\beta_1)=0$$. Indeed, recall that $$\beta_1\in
\pi_{10}(\S)\cong \pi_{10} \tmf$$, and is represented by an element of
$$\H^2(\Sigma_3; \pi_{12} \tmf(2))$$. As in our proof that $$\ell_1$$ kills
$$\alpha_1$$, it suffices to show that $$\ell_2:\gl_1 \tmf(2) \to \tmf(2)$$ is
zero on $$\pi_{12}$$ of the elements coming from $$\tmf_1(2)$$. A computation
proves that the Hecke operator $$T_3$$ acts on $$\pi_{12} \tmf_1(2) \cong
M_6(\Gamma_1(2))$$ (which is free of rank $$2$$). A straightforward computation
proves that $$T_3$$ acts by multiplication by $$244$$. It follows that
$$\ell_2$$ on $$\pi_{12}$$ is multiplication by $$1-244+3^{6-1} = 0$$, as
desired.

More generally, we can write down a descent spectral sequence for the map
$$\Tmf \to \Tmf_1(2)$$. As emphasized in the proofs above, in order to
understand $$\ell_2$$ for $$\tmf$$, we just need to understand the
corresponding representatives in the descent spectral sequence, and understand
the logarithm on $$\tmf_1(2)$$. We know that $$\pi_{2\ast} \tmf_1(2) \cong
M_\ast(\Gamma_1(2)) = \H^0(M_{\Gamma_1(2)}; \omega^{\otimes \ast}) \cong
\Z_3[\lambda_4,\lambda_8]$$, where $$|\lambda_i| = i$$. This ring admits a
Hecke decomposition: $$\H^0(M_{\Gamma_1(2)}; \omega^{\otimes \ast}) \cong
\H^0(M_{\Gamma_1(2)}; \omega^{\otimes \ast}(-\mathrm{cusps})) \oplus
\ce_k(\Gamma_1(2))$$. The action of the Hecke operator $$T_p$$ on
$$\ce_k(\Gamma_1(2))$$ is given by multiplication by $$1-p^{k-1}$$, so we find
that $$\ell_2$$ is zero on $$\pi_{2k} \tmf_1(2)$$ if $$\H^0(M_{\Gamma_1(2)};
\omega^{\otimes \ast}(-\mathrm{cusps}))$$ vanishes, i.e., if there are no
integral weight $$k$$ cusp forms for $$\Gamma_1(2)$$. Since
$$M_\ast(\Gamma_1(2))$$ is torsion-free, we can simply check this after
base-changing to $$\mathbf{C}$$. Then, we find that the dimension of the space
of weight $$k$$ cusp forms (for $$k\geq 3$$, but by case work there are no cusp
forms for $$k\leq 2$$) is $$\lfloor k/4 \rfloor-1$$ if $$k$$ is even and is
$$0$$ otherwise.

In particular, the first $$k$$ for which there is a cusp form for
$$\Gamma_1(2)$$ of weight $$k$$ is $$k=8$$, and in this case, a computer
calculation verifies that $$T_3$$ has a non-diagonal matrix. Therefore,
$$\ell_2:\pi_{16} \gl_1\tmf_1(2) \to \pi_{16} \tmf_1(2)$$ is nonzero. The
element $$\alpha_1\beta_1 \in \pi_{13} \tmf$$ is represented by an element of
$$\H^3(\Sigma_3; \pi_{16} \tmf(2))$$, so this suggests that
$$\ell_2(1+\alpha_1\beta_1) \in \pi_{13} \tmf$$ is nonzero. A choice of basis
for $$\pi_{16} \tmf(2)$$ is given by the modular forms

$$f_1 = q + 12q^3 - 210q^5 + O(q^6),\
f_2 = q^2 - 8q^4 + O(q^6),\
f_3 = 1 + 480q^4 + O(q^6),$$
$$f_4 = q + 2188q^3 + 78126q^5 + O(q^6),\
f_5 = q^2 + 128q^4 + O(q^6).$$

In this basis, the logarithm acts as the diagonal matrix

$$\pi_{16} \ell_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
    -2176 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & -2176 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{pmatrix}.$$

Since $$\H^s(\Sigma_3; \pi_{2t} \tmf(2)) \cong \H^s(\ol{\Mell}; \omega^{\otimes
t})$$ for $$t\geq 0$$, and we know the latter ring precisely, we know that
already at the $$E_2$$-page there is an isomorphism $$\H^3(\Sigma_3; \pi_{16}
\tmf(2)) \cong \Z/3$$. Since $$-2176\equiv 2\pmod{3}$$, I expect that
$$\ell_2(1+\alpha_1\beta_1) = 2\alpha_1\beta_1$$.
