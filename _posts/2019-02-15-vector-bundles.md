There's a very nice classical theorem of Bousfield's, stating that every finite
$$\KO$$-module which is free upon base-changing to $$\KU$$ is equivalent to a
wedge of shifts of $$\KO, \KU$$, and $$\KU^{h\Z} = \KO \wedge C\eta^2$$. In
section 7 of his
[thesis](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~meier007/Thesis-FinalVersionb.pdf),
Lennart Meier provides a modern proof of this theorem. This is a topological
analogue of the classification of integral $$\Z/2$$-representations, i.e., the
classification of vector bundles over $$B\Z/2$$. In light of this result, it's
interesting to ask about lifting vector bundles on a Deligne-Mumford stack
$$X$$ to an even-periodic refinement of $$X$$.

To this end, we can make the following statement. Let $$\dX$$ be an
even-periodic Deligne-Mumford stack with underlying quasi-compact and separated
Deligne-Mumford stack $$X$$. Suppose that $$X$$ is Gorenstein of Krull
dimension $$\leq 2$$, and that $$\pi_{2k} \co_\dX$$ is ample for some $$k\in
\Z$$ (let's call this assumption $$(\ast)$$). Then, for any $$\Z/2$$-graded
perfect complex $$\cf$$ on $$X$$ concentrated in homological degree zero, there
is a perfect $$\co_\dX$$-module $$\widetilde{\cf}$$ with $$\pi_0
\widetilde{\cf} \oplus \pi_1 \widetilde{\cf} \cong \cf$$.

Note that the ampleness assumption is satisfied in an important example, namely
when $$\dX$$ is the even-periodic refinement of the compactified moduli stack
$$\overline{\Mell}$$ giving $$\Tmf$$. Moreover, in this case, the underlying
stack $$X$$ is smooth (hence Gorenstein) and of Krull dimension $$\leq 2$$
(note that $$B\Z/2$$ has Krull dimension $$1$$ and $$\overline{\Mell}$$ has
Krull dimension $$2$$).

Also note that the situation is easier in the connective case: if $$A$$ is a
*connective* $$\E_\infty$$-ring, then there is a map $$A\to \pi_0 A$$. Suppose
$$A$$ is coherent, so that $$\pi_0 A$$ is coherent and $$\pi_k A$$ is a
finitely presented $$\pi_0 A$$-module for each $$k$$. Then $$\pi_0 A$$ is
almost perfect over $$A$$, so if $$\pi_0 A$$ is of finite Tor-amplitude as an
$$A$$-module, then Proposition 7.2.4.23(4) of *Higher Algebra* proves that
$$\pi_0 A$$ is perfect as an $$A$$-module. It follows that the functor
$$\mathrm{Mod}(\pi_0 A) \to \mathrm{Mod}(A)$$ preserves perfectness. The
nonconnective/even-periodic statement above is not as easy, because in this
setting, there is no map $$A\to \pi_0 A$$.

Let's now try to prove the claim made above. Write $$\cf = \cf_0 \oplus
\cf_1$$, so that our assumptions on $$\cf$$ imply that $$\cf_0$$ and $$\cf_1$$
are both perfect complexes on $$X$$ concentrated in homological degree zero.
The general case will therefore follow if for any perfect complex $$\cf$$
concentrated in homological degree zero, there is a perfect $$\co_\dX$$-module
$$\widetilde{\cf}$$ with $$\pi_\mathrm{odd} \widetilde{\cf} = 0$$ and $$\pi_0
\widetilde{\cf} \cong \cf$$. We shall argue by induction on the projective
dimension $$\mathrm{pd}(\cf)$$ of $$\cf$$. (Recall that a perfect complex is
quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of locally free $$\co_X$$-modules, and
the length of a minimal such complex is the projective dimension of this
perfect complex.)

We make a further reduction: it suffices to assume that $$\cf$$ is generated by
global sections. Indeed, suppose that the desired result is true for every
perfect complex concentrated in homological degree zero which is generated by
global sections. Then, for any $$\cf$$, we know that there is some $$m\gg 0$$
for which $$\cf\otimes (\pi_{2k} \co_\dX)^{\otimes m}$$ is generated by its
global sections, and therefore can be realized by some $$\widetilde{\cf}'$$. It
follows that $$\widetilde{\cf} := \Sigma^{-2km} \widetilde{\cf}'$$ is
concentrated in even degrees and $$\pi_0 \widetilde{\cf} = \cf$$.

If $$\cf$$ is a finitely generated free $$\co_X$$-module, then
$$\widetilde{\cf}$$ can be chosen to be the free $$\co_\dX$$-module on a finite
set of generators for $$\cf$$. If $$\mathrm{pd}(\cf) = 0$$, then $$\cf$$ is a
locally free $$\co_X$$-module, which we can assume is generated by global
sections. Say $$\cf$$ is locally free of rank $$n$$. We claim that $$\cf$$ is a
summand of $$\co_X^n$$. Indeed, choose a surjection $$s:\co_X^n \to \cf$$; this
exists because $$\cf$$ is generated by global sections. The map $$s$$ splits
because $$\cf$$ is a vector bundle, so $$\cf$$ is a summand of $$\co_X^n$$.
Therefore, there is an idempotent $$e\in \End_X(\co_X^n) = \pi_0
\End_\dX(\co_\dX^n)$$ which executes this splitting. It follows that the
idempotent $$e$$ lifts to one on $$\co_\dX^n$$, so that there is a perfect
$$\co_\dX$$-module $$\widetilde{\cf}$$ (which is concentrated in even degrees)
such that $$\pi_0 \widetilde{\cf} = \cf$$, as desired. Note that this did not
use the Gorenstein or the Krull dimension assumptions.

For the inductive step, assume $$\mathrm{pd}(\cf)>0$$. As proved above, we can
assume that $$\cf$$ is generated by global sections. Choose generators for
$$\cf$$, so we get a surjection $$\co_X^n \to \cf$$ from a finitely generated
free $$\co_X$$-module. Let $$\cg$$ denote the kernel of this map, so that
$$\mathrm{pd}(\cg) < \mathrm{pd}(\cf)$$. The inductive hypothesis implies that
we can lift $$\cg$$ to a perfect $$\co_\dX$$-module $$\widetilde{\cg}$$. To
lift $$\cf$$, it remains to lift the map $$\cg\to \co_X^n$$ to a map
$$\widetilde{\cg} \to \co_\dX^n$$. There is a spectral sequence

$$E_2^{s,t} = \mathrm{Ext}^s_X(\pi_0 \cf, \pi_t \cg) \Rightarrow \pi_{t-s}
\mathrm{Map}_\dX(\cf, \cg),$$

where $$\cf$$ and $$\cg$$ are evenly concentrated quasicoherent
$$\co_\dX$$-modules. We need to lift an element of $$E_2^{0,0} = \Hom_X(\cg,
\co_X^n)$$ to an element of $$\pi_0 \Map_\dX(\widetilde{\cg}, \co_\dX^n)$$, so
it suffices to prove that all differentials off of $$E_2^{0,0}$$ vanish. The
$$d_r$$-differential (note $$r\geq 2$$) lands in $$E_r^{r,r-1}$$, and this
target is a quotient of $$E_2^{r,r-1}$$. However, $$E_2^{r,r-1} = \Ext^r_X(\cg,
\pi_{r-1} \co_\dX^n)$$.  By evenness, $$E_2^{2r,2r-1} = 0$$ for all $$r$$, so
it suffices to prove that $$E_2^{2r+1,2r} = 0$$ for all $$r\geq 1$$. Since
$$\dX$$ is even *periodic*, $$\pi_{2r} \co_\dX$$ is an invertible
$$\co_X$$-module for all $$r$$; therefore

$$E_2^{2r+1,2r} = \Ext^{2r+1}_X(\cg, \pi_{2r} \co_\dX^n) \cong
\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \Ext^{2r+1}_X(\cg\otimes \pi_{-2r} \co_\dX, \co_X).$$

Since the Krull dimension of $$X$$ is at most $$2$$ and $$X$$ is Gorenstein,
the injective dimension of $$\co_X$$ as a $$\co_X$$-module coincides with the
Krull dimension, so $$\Ext^i_X(\cf', \co_X) = 0$$ for $$i\geq 3$$ for any
quasicoherent $$\co_X$$-module $$\cf'$$. In particular, $$E_2^{2r+1,2r} = 0$$
for $$r\geq 1$$, as desired.

Note that we do not make any Noetherian assumption. The above discussion in
fact shows that if $$\dX$$ is an even-periodic Deligne-Mumford stack with
underlying quasi-compact and separated Deligne-Mumford stack (no Noetherian,
Krull dimension, or smoothness assumptions!) $$X$$ such that $$\pi_{2k} \co_\dX
= (\pi_2 \co_\dX)^{\otimes k}$$ is ample for some $$k\in \Z$$ (let's call this
assumption $$(\ast\ast)$$, then *every*
$$\Z/2$$-graded vector bundle $$\cf$$ can be realized as $$\pi_0
\widetilde{\cf} \oplus \pi_1 \widetilde{\cf}$$ for some vector bundle
$$\widetilde{\cf}$$ on $$\dX$$.

How about morphisms? Suppose that $$\cf$$ and $$\cg$$ are $$\Z/2$$-graded
vector bundles on $$X$$, with $$X$$ satisfying assumption $$(\ast\ast)$$, and
let $$f_0:\cf \to \cg$$ be a morphism of vector bundles. We can then ask when
$$f_0$$ lifts to a map $$f:\widetilde{\cf} \to \widetilde{\cg}$$ of vector
bundles on $$\dX$$. There is a descent spectral sequence

$$E_2^{s,t} = \H^s(X; \pi_t \underline{\Hom}_X(\widetilde{\cf}, \widetilde{\cg})) \Rightarrow
\pi_{t-s} \Hom_\dX(\widetilde{\cf}, \widetilde{\cg}).$$

We know that

$$\pi_t \underline{\Hom}_X(\widetilde{\cf}, \widetilde{\cg}) \cong \underline{\Hom}_X(\cf,
\pi_t \widetilde{\cg}) \cong \begin{cases}
    \underline{\Hom}_X(\cf, \cg\otimes \omega^{\otimes t/2}) & \text{ if
    }t\text{ is even}\\
	0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}$$

In general, there is a spectral sequence

$$\H^i(X; \underline{\Ext}^j_X(\cf,\cg)) \Rightarrow \Ext^{i+j}_X(\cf, \cg);$$

since $$\cf$$ is a vector bundle, we conclude that $$E_2^{s,2t} = \Ext^s_X(\cf,
\cg\otimes \omega^{\otimes t})$$. If the stronger assumption $$(\ast)$$ is
satisfied, then the same argument as in the proof of the claim at the beginning
of this post shows that *any element* of $$\Hom_X(\cf, \cg)$$ is a permanent
cycle, and lifts to an element of $$\pi_0 \Hom_\dX(\widetilde{\cf},
\widetilde{\cg})$$.

Now suppose $$\cf$$ is a $$\Z/2$$-graded vector bundle on $$X$$ satisfying
assumption $$(\ast\ast)$$ which splits as $$\cf_1 \oplus \cf_2$$ in the
category of $$\Z/2$$-graded vector bundles. Then we can lift $$\cf,\cf_1$$, and
$$\cf_2$$ to vector bundles $$\widetilde{\cf}, \widetilde{\cf_1}$$, and
$$\widetilde{\cf_2}$$ by the discussion above. Moreover, the map $$\cf_1\oplus
\cf_2 \to \cf$$ lifts to a map $$\phi:\widetilde{\cf_1} \oplus
\widetilde{\cf_2} \to \widetilde{\cf}$$ such that the map on $$\pi_\ast$$ is an
isomorphism; therefore, $$\phi$$ itself is an equivalence.

Finally, let $$\widetilde{\cf}'$$ be a vector bundle on $$\dX$$, and let $$\cf
= \pi_0 \widetilde{\cf}' \oplus \pi_1 \widetilde{\cf}'$$ be the associated
$$\Z/2$$-graded vector bundle on $$X$$. Let $$\widetilde{\cf}$$ be the
associated vector bundle on $$\dX$$. The identity map on $$\cf$$ lifts to a map
$$\widetilde{\cf}\to \widetilde{\cf}'$$ which is an isomorphism on homotopy. It
follows that the map $$\widetilde{\cf}\to \widetilde{\cf}'$$ is an equivalence.
In other words, the lift constructed above of the $$\Z/2$$-graded bundle
determined by $$\pi_0\oplus \pi_1$$ of a vector bundle on $$\dX$$ is equivalent
to the original vector bundle.
