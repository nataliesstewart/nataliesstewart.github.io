We ended the [previous post](/chromotopy/2019/03/05/ln-log.html) by saying that
for a fixed finite $$n$$ and $$t\leq n$$, there is a $$\Eoo$$-map $$E_n \to
E_t$$ between Morava $$E$$-theories. We will discuss a construction of this map
in this post. To define this map, let $$G$$ denote a formal $$p$$-divisible
group of height $$n$$ over a perfect field $$k$$, and let $$E_n$$ denote the
Lubin-Tate spectrum associated to the formal group $$G$$. We will construct a
$$p$$-divisible group $$H$$ whose formal component has height $$t=n-1\leq n$$
over a perfect field $$F$$, and an $$\Eoo$$-ring map $$E_n \to E(H,F)$$.

Algebraically, our desired map goes from $$(\W(k)(\!(u_{n-1})\!)[\![u_1,
\cdots, u_{n-2}]\!])^\wedge_{(p, u_1, \cdots, u_{n-2})}$$ to
$$\W(F)[\![x_1,\cdots,x_{n-2}]\!]$$. There is a natural choice of $$F$$ for
which such a map exists: let $$F = k(\!(u_{n-1})\!)^\flat$$ denote the direct
limit perfection of the $$k$$-algebra $$k(\!(u_{n-1})\!)$$, i.e., the direct
limit of the diagram

$$k(\!(u_{n-1})\!) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{Frobenius}} k(\!(u_{n-1})\!)
\xrightarrow{\mathrm{Frobenius}} k(\!(u_{n-1})\!) \to \cdots$$

There is a naturally defined $$p$$-divisible group $$H$$ over
$$F = k(\!(u_{n-1})\!)^\flat$$: it is the pullback of the universal
deformation $$\wt{G}$$ of the formal $$p$$-divisible group $$G$$ along the map

$$f:\spec k(\!(u_{n-1})\!)^\flat \to \spec k(\!(u_{n-1})\!) \hookrightarrow
\spf k[\![u_{n-1}]\!] \hookrightarrow \spf \W(k)[\![u_1,\cdots,u_{n-1}]\!] =
\spf \pi_0 E_n,$$

which is the same as the map

$$\spec k(\!(u_{n-1})\!)^\flat \to \spec (\pi_0 E_n/p)^\flat \to \spec \pi_0
E_n/p \hookrightarrow \spf \pi_0 E_n.$$

Let $$\wt{G}'$$ denote the $$p$$-divisible group over $$\pi_0 E_n/p$$, so that
there are morphisms of pairs $$(k,G) \leftarrow (\pi_0 E_n/p, \wt{G}') \to (F,
H)$$. It is a consequence of Proposition 6.1.5 of [Lurie's
Elliptic II](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/Elliptic-II.pdf#page=252&zoom=100,0,490),
that there is an equivalence of *oriented* deformation $$\Eoo$$-rings $$E(k,G)
\leftarrow E(\pi_0 E_n/p, \wt{G}')$$ (thanks to Andy Senger for pointing this
out to me). We conclude from the main theorem of *loc. cit.* (in particular,
the functoriality) that there is a map of $$\Eoo$$-rings $$E(k,G) \to E(F,H)$$. 

At this point, we run into a slight issue: the formal component $$H^\circ$$ of
$$H$$ is of height $$n-1$$ (the associated Morava $$E$$-theory $$E(F,H^\circ)$$
is of height $$n-1$$), and although there is a map $$E(F,H^\circ) \to E(F,H)$$
of $$\Eoo$$-rings, this map will *not* be an equivalence. (This is why we do
not obtain a map between plain old Morava $$E$$-theories, as mentioned in the
first paragraph.) However, by [Theorem
6.2.4](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/papers/Elliptic-II.pdf#page=257&zoom=100,0,549)
of *loc. cit.*, the map between the unoriented deformation rings induced by the
map $$(F,H^\circ) \to (F,H)$$ is flat. Since the oriented deformation rings are
even-periodic, and $$\pi_0$$ of the oriented deformation ring is isomorphic to
$$\pi_0$$ of the unoriented deformation ring (the universal deformation is
"balanced"), this implies that the map $$E(F,H^\circ) \to E(F,H)$$ is flat as
well. Moreover, since $$\pi_0 E(F,H)$$ is the classical deformation ring of
$$H$$ over $$F$$, we find that the map $$\pi_0 E(F,H^\circ) \to \pi_0 E(F,H)$$
of classical rings is just given by the map $$\W(F)[\![u_1,\cdots,u_{n-2}]\!]
\to \W(F)[\![u_1,\cdots,u_{n-1}]\!]$$ sending $$u_i$$ to $$u_i$$. This map is
faithfully flat, too, so the map $$E(F,H^\circ) \to E(F,H)$$ of $$\Eoo$$-rings
is also faithfully flat. Corollary 3.33 from
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2156.pdf) is therefore applicable, and allows
us to conclude that the map $$E(F,H^\circ) \to E(F,H)$$ admits descent; in
other words, $$E(F,H^\circ)$$ is the geometric realization of the cosimplicial
object $$\{E(F,H)^{\otimes_{E(F,H^\circ)} \bullet+1}\}$$. Concretely, this
implies that smashing with $$E(F,H)$$ is conservative on
$$E(F,H^\circ)$$-modules, which in turn implies that the Bousfield class of
$$E(F,H)$$ agrees with that of $$E(F,H^\circ)$$.

We know that $$E(F,H^\circ)$$ is a Morava $$E$$-theory of height $$n-1$$, so
this tells us that $$E(F,H)$$-localization is equivalent to
$$L_{n-1}$$-localization, and that $$L_{n-1} \S$$ is the geometric realization
of the cosimplicial object $$\{E(F,H)^{\otimes \bullet+1}\}$$ by the
Hopkins-Ravenel smash product theorem. The map of $$\Eoo$$-rings $$E(k,G) \to
E(F,H)$$ we constructed above therefore determines a map
$$\{E(k,G)^{\bullet+1}\} \to \{E(F,H)^{\bullet+1}\}$$ of cosimplicial
$$\Eoo$$-rings, and this induces the canonical map $$L_n \S \to L_{n-1}\S$$
upon geometric realization. Since we can iterate the construction of the map
$$E(k,G) \to E(F,H)$$, we obtain for our fixed $$n$$, and any $$t\leq n$$, a
map of $$\Eoo$$-rings from $$E(k,G)$$ to another $$\Eoo$$-ring such that the
induced map on geometric realizations of the associated cosimplicial objects
induces the canonical map $$L_n \S \to L_t \S$$. The discussion at the end of
[our previous post](/chromotopy/2019/03/05/ln-log.html) now implies that for
any *fixed* $$n$$, we can construct maps $$\gl_1(L_t \S) \to L_t \S$$ for all
$$t\leq n$$ which are compatible with respect to the canonical maps $$L_{t'} \S
\to L_t \S$$ of $$\Eoo$$-rings for $$t' \geq t$$ (in other words, the obvious
diagram involving the maps $$\gl_1(L_{t'} \S) \to \gl_1(L_t \S)$$ and $$L_{t'}
\S\to L_t \S$$ commutes). These maps depend *a priori* on the choice of formal
group $$G$$ over $$k$$, but I would not be surprised if different choices of
height $$n$$ formal $$p$$-divisible group $$G$$ gave rise to the same maps
$$\gl_1(L_t \S) \to L_t\S$$.

(**Edit:** I should've added the following statement. Since $$F$$ is a perfect
field, the connected-etale sequence for $$H$$ splits. Because the deformation
theory of etale group schemes is trivial, we obtain an $$\Eoo$$-ring map
$$E(F,H) \to E(F, H^\circ)$$; this in turn gives an $$\Eoo$$-ring map $$E(k, G)
\to E(F, H) \to E(F, H^\circ)$$ between Morava $$E$$-theories of different
heights.)

Note that all of this requires $$n$$ to be finite and fixed: our construction
needs one to start off with a fixed formal $$p$$-divisible group of height
$$n$$ over a perfect field. In particular, we do *not* obtain a map $$\gl_1(\S)
\to \S$$.  Perhaps such a map could be constructed if the phrase "Morava
$$E$$-theory at infinite height" could be made to make sense.
