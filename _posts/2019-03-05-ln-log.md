In the [previous post](/chromotopy/2019/03/02/log.html), we explicitly computed
values of the $$K(1)$$- and $$K(2)$$-local logarithms $$\gl_1(\S) \to \Lk \S$$.
In this post, I want to return to conceptual theory, and ask the following
question: is there a map $$\gl_1(L_n \S) \to L_n \S$$? This is not a question
with a trivial answer: the Rezk logarithm takes values in *$$K(n)$$-local*
spectra, and lifting it to the $$L_n$$-local setting is, in general, pretty
hard. Naturally, you might wonder: why would one expect such a map to exist?
Such a map exists for both $$\KO$$ and $$\TMF$$ (the former being easy to
construct, the latter being due to
[Ando-Hopkins-Rezk](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~mando/papers/koandtmf.pdf)).
The example of $$\KO$$ doesn't indicate very much about why this "integral"
logarithm exists, but $$\TMF$$ is a good prototype: the key property used in
this latter case is that $$\TMF$$ is somehow built using $$p$$-divisible
groups, and these have a good theory of isogenies; this allows for the
construction of the "Atkin operator" (which we already implicitly used in the
previous post) that saves the day. I'll elaborate more on this below. Coming
back to $$\Ln \S$$: one expects there to be an integral logarithm for $$\Ln
\S$$, because this is somehow built from $$p$$-divisible groups. Morally
speaking, Lurie's theorem (which we discussed
[here](/algebraic-geometry/2019/02/21/p-div-gps.html)) says that $$L_{K(1)\vee
\cdots \vee K(n)} \S = (\Ln \S)^\wedge_p$$ is the "even-periodic refinement of
the moduli of $$p$$-divisible groups of height $$n$$". This is more precisely
reflected in homotopy theory by the Hopkins-Ravenel smash product theorem.
Since I will be working with $$p$$-divisible groups, I will now $$p$$-complete
everywhere, and I will really mean $$L_{K(1)\vee\cdots\vee K(n)}$$ when I write
$$\Ln$$.

With this convention, $$\KO$$ is already $$K(1)$$-local, and so constructing
the integral logarithm $$\gl_1(\KO) \to \KO$$ is just the definition of the
$$K(1)$$-local logarithm. (This is why the case of $$\KO$$ isn't very
enlightening.) Let's now try to construct a map $$\gl_1(\TMF) \to \TMF$$. The
Rezk logarithm supplies us with two maps $$\ell_1:\gl_1(\TMF) \to \Lone \TMF$$
and $$\ell_2: \gl_1(\TMF) \to \Ltwo \TMF$$. The targets of these maps in turn
map to $$\Lone \Ltwo \TMF$$, and so we can ask if the corresponding square
commutes. The answer is no (when is life ever this easy?) --- but there is a
map $$\Lone \TMF \to \Lone \TMF$$ for which the composite $$\gl_1(\TMF)
\xrightarrow{\ell_1} \Lone \TMF \to \Lone \TMF \to \Lone \Ltwo \TMF$$ agrees
with the map $$\ell_2: \gl_1(\TMF) \to \Lone \Ltwo \TMF$$.

Why does this map exist, and how is it constructed? In order to answer the
first part of this question, we need to recall Rezk's formula for the
$$K(n)$$-local logarithm on Morava $$E$$-theory. We know that $$\Ltwo \TMF$$ is
either a wedge of Morava $$E$$-theories (if $$p\geq 5$$) or is homotopy
equivalent to the homotopy fixed points $$E_2^{hG}$$ for some finite subgroup
$$G$$ of the Morava stabilizer group $$\Gamma$$ acting on the height $$2$$
Morava $$E$$-theory associated to the formal group of the supersingular point
of $$\TMF$$. Let's suppose that $$p=2,3$$, so that $$\Ltwo \TMF$$ is equivalent
to only one copy of $$E_2^{hG}$$. The map $$\ell_2:\gl_1(\TMF) \to \Ltwo \TMF =
E_2^{hG}$$ factors through $$\gl_1(E_2^{hG}) \simeq \gl_1(E_2)^{hG}$$. The Rezk
logarithm $$\ell_2:\gl_1(E_2) \to E_2$$ is $$\Gamma$$-equivariant, and the map
$$\gl_1(E_2^{hG}) \to E_2^{hG}$$ is just the $$G$$-fixed points of this map.
Let's restrict ourselves to just understanding the map $$\ell_2:\gl_1(E_2) \to
E_2$$.

In this case, [Rezk
proves](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2980/0c9f3d799aa6bd880847b1b7f723899c31a6.pdf)
the following (see [here](https://www3.nd.edu/~mbehren1/other/eisenstein.pdf)
as well): let $$\GG$$ denote the universal deformation (over $$\pi_0 E_2$$) of
the formal group of the supersingular curve over $$\Mell$$ (at $$p=2,3$$), and
for $$i=1,2$$, let $$\GG^{(n)}$$ denote the formal group of height $$i$$ over
$$\Lk E_2$$. If $$H$$ is a subgroup of order $$p$$ of $$\GG$$, then there is a
map $$\psi_H$$ from the Lubin-Tate ring $$\pi_0 E_2$$ to the Lubin-Tate ring
with $$\Gamma_0(p)$$-level structure, classifying the quotient formal group
$$\GG/H$$; this is the statement that $$\GG/H$$ is another universal
deformation of the formal group of the supersingular curve, i.e., that
universal deformations are "closed under $$p$$-isogenies".

For $$j=1,2$$ and fixed $$n\in \{1,2\}$$, define an additive operator $$T_j$$
(the "Hecke operator") as follows:

$$T_j = \frac{1}{p^j} \sum_{H\leq \GG^{(n)}[p], \ |H| = p^j} \psi_H. \ (\ast)$$

Then, Rezk's formula states that if $$X$$ is a space, then the map
$$\ell_n:[X,\gl_1(E_2)] = (E_2^0 X)^\times \to (\Lk E_2)^0 X$$ is given on an
element $$x = 1+\epsilon\in (E_2^0 X)^\times$$ with $$\epsilon^2 = 0$$ (as is
the case for every element when $$X$$ is a sphere) by

$$\ell_n(1+\epsilon) = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j p^{j(j-1)/2} T_j(\epsilon). \
(\ast\ast)$$

More explicitly, this states that

$$\ell_1(1+\epsilon) = 1 - \frac{1}{p} \psi_{\GG^{(1)}[p]^\circ}, \
\ell_2(1+\epsilon) = 1 - \frac{1}{p} \sum_{H\leq \GG[p], \ |H| = p} \psi_H +
\frac{1}{p} \psi_{\GG[p^2]},$$

where $$\GG[p]^\circ$$ denotes the infinitesimal component of the $$p$$-torsion
group scheme $$\GG[p]$$. Note that the operator $$\frac{1}{p} \sum_{H\leq
\GG[p], \ |H| = p} \psi_H$$ appearing in $$\ell_2$$ is precisely the classical
$$p$$th Hecke operator $$T_p$$ which is defined via the correspondence $$\Mell
\to M_{\Gamma_0(p)} \leftarrow \Mell$$.

I claimed above that there is a map $$f:\Lone \TMF \to \Lone \TMF$$ which upon
composition with $$\ell_1$$ gives $$\ell_2$$. Algebraically, this is the
statement that there is a map $$f: \pi_0 \Lone E_2 \to \pi_0 \Lone E_2$$ such
that $$f\circ \ell_1 = \ell_2$$. The above formulae show that we need

$$f = 1 - \frac{1}{p} \sum_{H\leq \GG[p], \ H\cap \GG[p]^\circ = 0, \ |H| = p}
\psi_H.$$

The operator defined by the sum above (i.e., $$1-f$$) is called the *Atkin
operator*, and is denoted by $$U_p$$. (We already implicitly used this map in
the previous post.) Since $$\ell_1$$ and $$\ell_2$$ are defined via maps of
spectra, we would like to say that $$f$$ is actually induced from a map $$\Lone
\TMF \to \Lone \TMF$$ of spectra.

To do so, we will use Theorem 2.9 [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05116.pdf)
(or rather, the obvious adaptation of that result to periodic $$\TMF$$). The
problem of constructing a spectrum map $$\Lone \TMF \to \Lone \TMF$$ now
reduces to constructing a map purely on the level of algebra. In order to
define this map, we need to define an intermediate moduli problem: let
$$\Mell^\mathrm{ord}$$ denote the ordinary locus of the moduli stack of
elliptic curves, and let $$\Mell^\mathrm{ord,triv}$$ denote the moduli stack of
elliptic curves $$E$$ along with a closed immersion $$\mu_{p^\infty} \to
E[p^\infty]$$ which is an isomorphism on the connected component of the
identity. This is a $$\Z_p^\times = \Aut(\mu_{p^\infty})$$-torsor over
$$\Mell^\mathrm{ord}$$, and if we define $$V_\infty =
\Gamma(\Mell^\mathrm{ord,triv}, \co_{\Mell^\mathrm{ord,triv}})$$, then the
cited reference states that there is an isomorphism $$[\Lone \TMF, \Lone \TMF]
\to \Hom^\mathrm{cont}_{\Z_p^\times}(V_\infty, V_\infty)$$. To define the
desired lift of $$f$$ to $$\Lone \TMF$$, we therefore need to simply define
$$f$$ as a continuous $$\Z_p^\times$$-equivariant map $$V_\infty \to
V_\infty$$. The formula for $$f$$ given above already does that for us! In this
case, $$\GG$$ would be the $$p$$-divisible group of the universal elliptic
curve over $$\Mell^\mathrm{ord,triv}$$, and $$\psi_H$$ would be defined in the
same way as before; this relies on the fact that the ordinary elliptic curves
are closed under $$p$$-isogenies.

We've now got our desired map $$f:\Lone \TMF \to \Lone \TMF$$ which ensures
that the composites $$\gl_1(\TMF) \xrightarrow{\ell_1} \Lone \TMF
\xrightarrow{f} \Lone \TMF \to \Lone \Ltwo \TMF$$ and $$\gl_1(\TMF)
\xrightarrow{\ell_2} \Lone \Ltwo \TMF$$ agree. In particular, since $$\TMF$$ is
$$K(1)\vee K(2)$$-local (remember, we $$p$$-completed everywhere!), we obtain
an "integral logarithm" $$\ell:\gl_1(\TMF) \to \TMF$$. This map is defined such
that the fiber of $$\ell$$ is equivalent to the fiber of the map $$f$$ (in
other words, $$\ell$$ and $$f$$ sit inside a pullback diagram), which in turn
is related on homotopy to the spectrum of the Atkin operator $$U_p$$. There's
apparently a lot of deep number theory that goes into understanding this
spectrum, and it would be interesting to use some calculations from there to
understand the integral logarithm $$\ell$$. The calculations we did in the
[previous post](/chromotopy/2019/03/02/log.html) boil down to working with
$$\ell$$; we showed, for instance, that $$\alpha_1$$ and $$\beta_1$$ are both
killed by $$\ell$$.

How can we use this obtain an integral logarithm for $$L_n \S$$? Recall that
the Hopkins-Ravenel smash product theorem says that $$\Ln$$-localization is
smashing. In the [course of proving
it](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~lurie/252xnotes/Lecture31.pdf), one finds that
$$\Ln$$-localization being smashing is equivalent to the statement that $$\Ln
\S$$ is the geometric realization of the cosimplicial diagram defined by
$$\{E_n^{\otimes \bullet+1}\}$$. The functor $$\gl_1$$ preserves limits (see
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7702.pdf#page=7&zoom=100,0,356)), so in order
to define a map $$\gl_1(\Ln \S) \to \Ln \S$$, it suffices to define a map
$$\{\gl_1(E_n^{\otimes \bullet+1})\} \to \{E_n^{\otimes \bullet+1}\}$$ of
cosimplicial objects. The first level is easy: this is just going to be the
Rezk logarithm $$\gl_1(E_n) \to E_n$$. The next layer, however, is scarier: we
need to define a map $$\gl_1(E_n\otimes E_n) \to E_n\otimes E_n$$, but the
*uncompleted* (i.e., non-$$K(n)$$-localized) smash product $$E_n\otimes E_n$$
strikes fear into my heart.

Some of fears may melt at height $$2$$: it is in fact true that $$L_2 \S$$ is
the geometric realization of the cosimplicial diagram defined by
$$\{\TMF^{\otimes \bullet+1}\}$$ (so that defining a map $$\gl_1(L_2 \S) \to
L_2\S$$ reduces to constructing a map $$\{\gl_1(\TMF^{\otimes \bullet+1})\} \to
\{\TMF^{\otimes \bullet+1}\}$$ of cosimplicial spectra). Why is this true? As I
said above, the smash product theorem is equivalent to the statement that $$\Ln
\S$$ is the geometric realization of the cosimplicial diagram $$\{E_n^{\otimes
\bullet+1}\}$$. This is because $$A$$-localization is smashing if and only if
$$L_A \S$$ is the geometric realization of the cosimplicial diagram
$$\{A^{\otimes \bullet+1}\}$$. In order to prove the statement made at the
beginning of this paragraph, it therefore suffices to prove that $$\TMF$$ has
the same Bousfield class as $$E_2$$.

To see this, consider the finite etale cover $$M_{\Gamma_1(3)} \to \Mell$$ at
$$p=2$$ (at $$p=3$$, one uses the cover $$M_{\Gamma_1(2)} \to \Mell$$). Since
this map is etale and $$M_{\Gamma_1(3)}$$ is affine, this corresponds to an
$$\Eoo$$-map $$\TMF \to \TMF_1(3)$$ of $$\Eoo$$-rings, where $$\TMF_1(3)$$ is
Landweber exact. This map is an etale cover, in the sense that $$\TMF \simeq
\mathrm{Tot}(\TMF_1(3)^{\otimes_{\TMF} \bullet+1})$$; this implies the concrete
statement that a $$\TMF$$-module is zero if and only if it is zero after
base-changing up to $$\TMF_1(3)$$. In particular, $$\TMF$$ and $$\TMF_1(3)$$
have the same Bousfield class. We are therefore reduced to showing that
$$\TMF_1(3)$$ has the same Bousfield class as $$E_2$$. This is because
$$\TMF_1(3)$$ is Landweber exact and $$v_2$$-periodic, so we win by Corollary
1.12 of [this paper of
Hovey's](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?rep=rep1&type=pdf&doi=10.1.1.212.616).

We've now shown that $$L_2 \S\simeq \mathrm{Tot}(\TMF^{\otimes \bullet+1})$$;
from the moral point of view that $$L_2 \S$$ (really, I mean $$L_{K(1)\vee
K(2)} \S$$) is the global sections of an even-periodic refinement of
$$M_p(2)$$, this is an analogue of the fact that there is a formally etale
map $$\Mell \to M_p(2)$$. As I said above, defining a map $$\gl_1(L_2 \S) \to
L_2\S$$ now reduces to constructing a map $$\{\gl_1(\TMF^{\otimes \bullet+1})\}
\to \{\TMF^{\otimes \bullet+1}\}$$ of cosimplicial spectra. Although we won't
prove exactly this, we will obtain a map $$\gl_1(L_2\S) \to L_2\S$$ as a
consequence of the following two observations:

* The story I told above for defining the Atkin operator, and therefore the
  integral logarithm for $$\TMF$$, works for the global sections $$A$$ of any
derived stack arising via Lurie's theorem (which we discussed
[here](/algebraic-geometry/2019/02/21/p-div-gps.html)): the condition in
Lurie's theorem amounts to being "closed under $$p$$-isogenies". The formulae
$$(\ast)$$ and $$(\ast\ast)$$ above are exactly the same, except now $$n$$ and
$$j$$ can run over all integers between $$1$$ and the height of $$A$$.
* Let $$A$$ denote the global sections of the even-periodic refinement of the
  formally etale map $$\Mell^{\times_{M_p(2)} \bullet} \to M_p(2)$$. (Making
this precise takes some technical maneuvering.) One might expect this spectrum
to be $$\TMF\otimes \TMF$$, but the best one can say in general is that there
is an $$\Eoo$$-ring map $$\TMF\otimes \TMF \to A$$. We may then consider the
geometric realization $$R$$ of the cosimplicial diagram defined by
$$\{A^{\otimes_\TMF \bullet}\}$$; note that if $$A = \TMF\otimes \TMF$$, then
this is the geometric realization of the diagram $$\{\TMF^{\otimes
\bullet+1}\}$$, which we showed above is $$L_2\S$$. We claim that, in fact, $$R
\simeq L_2\S$$. Here's a sketch. There is a map $$\{\TMF^{\otimes \bullet+1}\}
\to \{\TMF^{\otimes_R \bullet}\}$$, and to obtain an equivalence between their
totalizations, I just need to note that there are compatible maps
$$\TMF^{\otimes_R n} \to \TMF^{\otimes n-1}$$ which assemble into a morphism of
cosimplicial objects. This forces $$R$$ to be $$L_2\S$$.

One can run the same story at any height, and this gives a map
$$\gl_1(L_{K(1)\vee \cdots \vee K(n)} \S) \to L_{K(1)\vee \cdots \vee K(n)}
\S$$, which can be extended to a map $$\gl_1(L_n\S) \to L_n\S$$. This is very
cool, and raises numerous interesting questions. For instance, the chromatic
convergence theorem states that $$\S \simeq \varprojlim L_n \S$$, and so one
can ask if the maps $$\gl_1(L_n\S) \to L_n\S$$ are compatible as $$n$$ varies.
It is not at all clear from the above description that this is actually the
case --- everything we did was very height-specific. I'll return to this
question in a later post, but let me briefly mention the plan of attack.
Although we didn't do it this way, the map $$\gl_1(L_n\S) \to L_n\S$$ can be
constructed as a map $$\{\gl_1(E_n^{\otimes \bullet+1})\} \to \{E_n^{\otimes
\bullet+1}\}$$ of cosimplicial objects, and so to get compatibility as $$n$$
varies, one would somehow like to construct compatible $$\Eoo$$-maps $$E_n \to
E_{n-1}$$. What we will (roughly) do in the next post is construct a map $$E_n
\to E_t$$ between Morava $$E$$-theories for any *fixed* finite $$n$$ and any
$$t\leq n$$, but where $$\pi_0 E_t$$ classifies deformations of a formal group
over a *big* perfect field (in particular, it does not classify deformations of
the Honda formal group law). Unfortunately, I don't think that the maps we'll
construct will be compatible as $$n$$ varies (so in particular, we won't be
constructing a map $$\gl_1(\S) \to \S$$).
