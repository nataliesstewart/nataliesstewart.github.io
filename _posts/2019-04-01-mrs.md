In [this
paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d073/ce79da5ab0b0d0333b8c39ff2ccb6f9d30ef.pdf),
Mahowald, Ravenel, and Shick study a spectrum denoted $$y(n)$$ in an approach
meant to attack the telescope conjecture. In this post, I want to discuss this
spectrum and its relation to [this previous
post](/algebraic-topology/2019/03/25/c-or.html). Let's begin with the
definition of $$y(n)$$: consider the map $$\Omega^2 S^3 \to B\GL_1(\S)$$
classifying $$-1$$; then, there's a map $$\Omega J_{p^n-1}(S^2) \to \Omega^2
S^3$$, and the Thom spectrum of the induced spherical bundle over $$\Omega
J_{p^n-1}(S^2)$$ is $$y(n)$$. After Definition 3.2 in their paper, MRS suggest
that if $$V(n-1)$$ exists, and $$p>2$$, that there is an equivalence
$$T(n)\wedge V(n-1) \simeq y(n)$$. (Recall that $$T(n)$$ is a summand of
$$X(k)$$ for $$p^n\leq k < p^{n+1}$$; in particular, $$T(n)$$ is a summand of
$$X(p^{n+1}-1)$$.) In this post, I'd like to try to prove a version of this
statement at $$p=2$$.

Of course, $$V(0)$$ exists at all primes, so you'd expect $$T(1)/p = y(1)$$.
The left hand side is the Thom spectrum of the map $$S^1\times \Omega S^{2p-1}
\to B\GL_1(\S)$$ detecting $$(1-p,\alpha_1)$$, and the right hand side is the
Thom spectrum of the map $$\Omega J_{p-1}(S^2) \to B\GL_1(\S)$$. There are maps
$$\Omega S^{2p-1} \to \Omega J_{p-1}(S^2)$$ and $$S^1 \to \Omega
J_{p-1}(S^2)$$ of spaces over $$B\GL_1(\S)$$. The latter is easy to construct:
it is the adjoint to the composite of the inclusion $$S^2 \to J_{p-1}(S^2)$$ of
the bottom cell with the degree $$1-p$$ map $$S^2 \to S^2$$.  The former map is
defined as follows: the map $$S^{2p-1} \to \Omega S^3$$ classifying
$$\alpha_1$$ factors through $$J_{p-1}(S^2)$$, by cellular approximation;
therefore, you get a map $$\Omega S^{2p-1} \to \Omega J_{p-1}(S^2)$$ of spaces
over $$B\GL_1(\S)$$. What we obtain from this is a map $$S^1\times \Omega
S^{2p-1} \to \Omega J_{p-1}(S^2)$$ of spaces over $$B\GL_1(\S)$$, and hence a
map $$T(1)/p \to y(1)$$ of Thom spectra. 

OK, what about higher $$n$$? Note that the story we ran above for $$n=1$$
doesn't work: $$V(k)$$ is *not* a spherical Thom spectrum for $$k>0$$.  Indeed,
suppose otherwise, and write $$V(k) = X^\mu$$. Then $$\H^\ast(V(k);\FF_p) \cong
\H^\ast(X;\FF_p)\cdot u$$ for some $$u$$ of degree zero. The $$2p$$-skeleton
(resp. the $$10$$-skeleton) of $$V(k)$$ for $$p$$ odd (resp. $$p=2$$) is
$$V(1)$$, so it suffices to show that there cannot exist a space $$X$$ for
which $$\H^\ast(V(1);\FF_p) \cong \H^\ast(X;\FF_p)\cdot u$$.  This is an easy
consequence of unstability and the fact that $$\mathrm{P}^1(u) = 0$$ (resp.
$$\Sq^8(u) = 0$$) in the cohomology of $$V(1)$$.

Can we at least define a map $$T(n) \to y(n)$$? Let's try instead to define a
map $$X(p^n) \to y(n)$$. For this, we'll induct on $$n$$, using [Beardsley's
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03042.pdf), which exhibits $$X(p^n)$$ as an
$$\E_1$$-quotient of $$X(p^n-1)$$ by a class $$\chi_{|v_n|-1}$$ of degree
$$|v_n|-1$$. Since $$y(n)$$ is an $$\E_1$$-algebra, it suffices to show that
$$\chi_{|v_i|-1}$$ is null in $$\pi_\ast y(n)$$ for all $$i\leq n$$. This is
true because the map $$y(n) \to \H\FF_p$$ is an equivalence up through (and
including) dimension $$2p^n-3$$, and since $$\chi_{|v_m|-1}$$ is null in
$$\pi_\ast \H\FF_p$$ for all $$m$$.

Note that $$y(n)$$ will be homotopy commutative if $$\Omega J_{p^n-1}(S^2)$$ is
homotopy commutative. It turns out that this is true for $$p\geq 3$$: see [this
MathOverflow
question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/286046/is-omega-j-pn-1s2-commutative-up-to-homotopy).
Unfortunately, $$\Omega J_{2^n-1}(S^2)$$ will not be homotopy commutative in
general. But that's OK; one can interpret the previous paragraph as saying that
the homotopy commutative map $$T(n) \to \mathrm{BP} \to (\Omega^2 S^3)^\mu$$
factors through $$y(n)$$.

Great; to get a map $$T(n)/(2,v_1,\cdots,v_{n-1}) \to y(n)$$ (note: not $$T(n)
\wedge V(n-1)$$, which wouldn't make sense at $$p=2$$), we now just need to
show that $$2,v_1,\cdots,v_{n-1}$$ vanish in the $$2$$-series of $$y(n)$$,
i.e., the "$$(2^n-1)$$-bud" (i.e., formal group law up to degree $$2^n-1$$) of
$$y(n)$$ is of "height $$\geq n$$". The desired vanishing of
$$2,v_1,\cdots,v_{n-1}$$ now follows quickly from the complex orientability of
$$\H\FF_2$$, noting that the height $$h$$ of an $$n$$-bud is defined when
$$p^h\leq n$$.

We've now got a candidate map which we'd like to show is an equivalence. Recall
that $$\H_\ast(y(n)) \cong \FF_2[\zeta_1, \cdots, \zeta_n]$$, and that
$$\H_\ast(T(n)) \cong \FF_2[\zeta_1^2, \cdots, \zeta_n^2]$$. It is not hard to
see that the map $$T(n)/(2,v_1,\cdots,v_{n-1}) \to y(n)$$ is a mod $$2$$
homology isomorphism, and hence a $$2$$-complete equivalence. Let's note one
interesting consequence.

Since $$T(n)$$ is a summand of $$X(p^{n+1}-1)$$, which is equivalent to
$$\mathrm{BP}$$ through dimension $$2(p^{n+1}-1)-1$$, there is an element
$$v_n\in \pi_{|v_n|} T(n)$$. This pushes forward to an element $$v_n\in
\pi_{|v_n|} y(n)$$. We can alternatively construct this element in the
following manner: the EHP sequence $$\Omega J_{p^n-1} S^2 \to \Omega^2 S^3 \to
\Omega^2 S^{2p^n+1}$$ defines a map $$\Omega^2 S^{2p^n+1} \to B\GL_1(y(n))$$,
hence an element in $$\pi_{|v_n|} y(n)$$. Note that the Thom spectrum of the
map $$\Omega^2 S^{2p^n+1} \to B\GL_1(y(n))$$ is $$\H\FF_p$$. This is
interesting: it's saying that the "$$\E_2$$-quotient" of
$$T(n)/(p,v_1,\cdots,v_{n-1})$$ by $$v_n$$ (which is well-defined mod
$$(p,v_1,\cdots,v_{n-1})$$) is $$\H\FF_p$$. 

Can we get an "integral" analogue of this result, perhaps something saying that
the "$$\E_2$$-quotient" (in quotes because I don't know if $$T(n)$$ an
$$\E_2$$-ring) of $$T(n)$$ by "$$v_n$$" (in quotes because $$v_n$$ is not
canonical unless you kill $$p,v_1,\cdots,v_{n-1}$$) is $$\BP{n-1}$$? Let's
begin with the simplest case: $$n=1$$. In this case, $$T(n)$$ is actually a
Thom spectrum: as we've already used above, it's the Thom spectrum of the map
$$\Omega S^{2p-1} \to B\GL_1(\S)$$. It'd be great if there was a map $$\Omega^2
S^{2p+1} \to B\GL_1(T(1))$$ (detecting "$$v_1$$") whose Thom spectrum is
$$\H\Z$$. We'd obtain such a map if there was a fiber sequence $$\Omega
S^{2p-1} = \Omega S^3 \to \Omega^2 (S^3\langle 3\rangle) \to \Omega^2 S^{2p+1}
= \Omega^2 S^5$$. If this is a fiber sequence of loop maps, then this is the
same as a fiber sequence $$S^3 \to \Omega (S^3\langle 3\rangle) \to \Omega
S^5$$, i.e., a fiber sequence $$\Omega (S^3\langle 3\rangle) \to \Omega S^5\to
\HP^\infty$$. (Note that even constructing the map $$\Omega S^5\to \HP^\infty$$
is not obvious: although you have an obvious map $$S^4\to \HP^\infty$$, this
doesn't canonically extend to a map from $$\Omega S^5$$, because $$\HP^\infty$$
is [not even a
H-space](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/109444/is-mathbbhp-infty-p-an-h-space)!)

There are fiber sequences $$\ast \to S^2 \to S^2$$ (obvious), $$\Omega
(S^3\langle 3\rangle)\to \Omega S^3 \to \CP^\infty$$ (by looping the definition
of $$S^3\langle 3\rangle$$ as the fiber of the map $$S^3\to K(\Z,3)$$), $$S^2
\to \Omega S^3 \to \Omega S^5$$ (EHP), and $$S^2 \to \CP^\infty \to
\HP^\infty$$ (equivalent to the Hopf fibration $$S^1 \to S^3 \to S^2$$). These
fit into a commutative square, and define for us the desired fiber sequence
$$\Omega^2 (S^3\langle 3\rangle) \to \Omega^2 S^5\to S^3$$. We conclude that
there is a ($$2$$-local) map $$\Omega^2 S^5 \to B\GL_1(T(1))$$ (detecting a
class which deserves to be called "$$v_1$$") whose Thom spectrum is $$\H\Z$$.

It turns out that all of this can be made to work *$$C_2$$-equivariantly*.
Here's how the story goes. We [know](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02582) that the
Thom spectrum of the map $$\Omega^\rho S^{\rho+1} \xrightarrow{1-2=-1}
B\GL_1(\S)$$ is $$\H\ul{\FF}_2$$. This gives two possible definitions of the
equivariant analogue of $$y(n)$$: first, as the Thom spectrum of the induced
bundle via the map $$\Omega J^\sigma_{2^n-1}(S^2) \to \Omega \Omega^\sigma
S^{\sigma+2}$$, or as the Thom spectrum of the induced bundle via the map
$$\Omega^\sigma J_{2^n-1}(S^\rho) \to \Omega^\sigma \Omega S^{\rho+1}$$. Let's
call the resulting Thom spectra $$z(n)_\RR$$ and $$y(n)_\RR$$; it turns out
that $$y(n)_\RR$$ is actually $$C_2$$-equivariantly equivalent to $$z(n)_\RR$$.
The map $$y(n)_\RR \to \H\ul{\FF}_2$$ is an equivalence through degree
$$|\ol{v}_n| = (2^i-1)\rho$$.

The spectrum $$T(1)_\RR$$ is the free $$\E_1$$-ring with a nullhomotopy of the
equivariant Hopf map $$\wt{\eta}:S^\sigma\to S^0$$. In other words, it is the
Thom spectrum of the map $$\Omega S^{\rho+1} \to B\GL_1(\S)$$. There's an
interesting comment to make here: $$\Omega S^{\rho+1} = \Omega \Omega^\sigma
\HP^\infty_\RR = \Omega^\sigma S^{\rho+\sigma}$$, so $$T(1)_\RR$$ is also the
free $$\E_\sigma$$-ring with a nullhomotopy of $$\wt{\eta}$$. More generally,
one can define $$T(n)_\RR$$ as a summand of $$X(p^n)_\RR = (\Omega
\mathrm{SU}(n))^\mu$$. There are elements $$\ol{v_i} \in \pi_{(2^i-1)\rho}
\mathrm{BP}$$, and some of these live in $$T(n)_\RR$$. As before, (I think, if
I've calculated correctly) we find that
$$T(n)_\RR/(2,\ol{v_1},\cdots,\ol{v_{n-1}}) = y(n)_\RR$$.

Now, consider the unit map $$S^{\rho+1} \to \Omega^\infty(\Sigma^{\rho+1}
\H\ul{\Z}) = B \CP^\infty_\RR$$, and let $$S^{\rho+1}\langle \rho+1\rangle$$
denote its fiber. Then the Thom spectrum of the map $$\Omega^\rho
S^{\rho+1}\langle \rho+1\rangle \to B\GL_1(\S)$$ is $$\H\ul{\Z}$$. What we'd
like to show is that there is a map $$\Omega^\rho S^{2\rho+1} \to
B\GL_1(T(1)_\RR)$$ whose Thom spectrum is also $$\H\ul{\Z}$$. This is true by
the same argument as in the classical case, using the fiber sequence
$$\Omega^\sigma S^{\rho+\sigma} = \Omega S^{\rho+1} \to \Omega^\rho
S^{\rho+1}\langle \rho+1\rangle \to \Omega^\rho S^{2\rho+1}$$ constructed via
the fiber sequences $$\Omega S^{\rho+1}\langle \rho+1\rangle \to \Omega
S^{\rho+1} \to \CP^\infty_\RR$$, $$S^\rho \to \Omega S^{\rho+1} \to \Omega
S^{2\rho+1}$$ (EHP), and $$S^\rho \to \CP^\infty_\RR = BS^\sigma \to
\HP^\infty_\RR = BS^{\rho+\sigma}$$.

Let's return back to this question of whether the "$$\E_2$$-quotient" of
$$T(n)$$ by "$$v_n$$" is $$\BP{n-1}$$. As I said earlier, there are a few
problems with this question: first, is $$T(n)$$ even an $$\E_2$$-ring? Second,
there's no unique choice of $$v_n$$. Nonetheless, we constructed, in the case
when $$p=2$$ and $$n=1$$, a fiber sequence $$\Omega S^3 \to \Omega^2 S^3\langle
3\rangle \to \Omega^2 S^5$$, such that the induced map $$\Omega^2 S^5 \to
B\GL_1((\Omega S^3)^\mu) = B\GL_1(T(1))$$ Thomifies to $$\H\Z$$. More
generally, there is a $$p$$-local fiber sequence $$\Omega S^{2p-1} \to
\Omega^2 S^3\langle 3\rangle \to \Omega^2 S^{2p+1}$$, given by patching
together the fiber sequences $$\Omega J_{p-1} S^2 \to \Omega^2 S^3 \to \Omega^2
S^{2p+1}$$ (EHP), $$\Omega S^1 = \Z \to \Omega^2 S^3\langle 3\rangle \to
\Omega^2 S^3$$ (definition), and $$\Omega^2 J_{p-1}(S^2) \to \Omega S^1 \to
\Omega S^{2p-1}$$ (coming from the fiber sequence $$S^1 \to S^{2p-1}
\xrightarrow{\alpha_1} J_{p-1}(S^2)$$; one can check that the fiber of the map
$$\alpha_1$$ above is indeed $$S^1$$ via the Serre spectral sequence). This
fiber sequence gives a map $$\Omega^2 S^{2p+1} \to B\GL_1((\Omega
S^{2p-1})^\mu) = B\GL_1(T(1))$$ which Thomifies to $$\H\Z$$.

OK, now what? Recall that Beardsley
[constructs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03042.pdf) elements $$\chi_n\in
\pi_{2n-1}(X(n))$$ (all $$p$$-localized) so that $$X(n+1)$$ is the
$$\E_1$$-quotient of $$X(n)$$ by $$\chi_n$$. This tells us that $$T(n+1)$$ is
the $$\E_1$$-quotient of $$T(n)$$ by a map $$\sigma_n = \chi_{p^{n+1}-1}:
S^{|v_{n+1}|-1} \to T(n)$$, i.e., $$T(n+1)$$ is the Thom spectrum of a map
$$\Omega S^{|v_{n+1}|-1} \to B\GL_1(T(n))$$. What we'd *like* is if there was a
map $$\Omega^2 S^{|v_{n+1}|+3} \to B\GL_1(T(n+1))$$ --- not a loop map, because
I don't know if that would make sense --- Thomifying to $$\BP{n}$$. 

We know that if $$F\to E \to B$$ is a fiber sequence and $$\mu:E\to B\GL_1(R)$$
is a map, then there is a map $$B \to B\GL_1(F^\mu)$$, so this suggests a
natural plan of attack: find a fiber sequence $$\Omega S^{|v_n|+1} = \Omega
S^{2p^n-1} \to Z \to \Omega^2 S^{|v_n|+3} = \Omega^2 S^{2p^n+1}$$ for some
space $$Z$$, and a map $$Z\to B\GL_1(T(n-1))$$ whose Thom spectrum is
$$\BP{n-1}$$. Delooping and rotating our desired fiber sequence tells us that
we'd like a fiber sequence $$\Omega^2 S^{2p^n+1} \to S^{2p^n-1} \to BZ$$, with
the first map inducing multiplication by $$p$$ on $$(2p^n-1)$$st homotopy
groups.

Aha! There *is* in fact such a map $$\Omega^2 S^{2k+1} \to S^{2k-1}$$ after
$$p$$-localizing (for $$p\geq 3$$, which we'll now adhere to) and $$k\geq 2$$;
our desired map is the special case $$k=p^n$$. This comes from work of
Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer (there are lots of papers about this, but see, e.g.,
Theorem 8
[here](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0088074.pdf) for a
statement), where they prove that the map $$\Omega^2 p: \Omega^2 S^{2k+1} \to
\Omega^2 S^{2k+1}$$ factors through the double suspension $$S^{2k-1} \to
\Omega^2 S^{2k+1}$$. For $$k=2$$, the map $$\Omega^2 S^5 \to S^3$$ is the same
map we constructed above. In Problem 5(h) of the linked paper,
Cohen-Moore-Neisendorfer ask if there is a fiber sequence $$S^{2k-1} \to B(k)
\to \Omega S^{2k+1}$$ (they also say that Toda had constructed such a fibration
for $$k=p$$, with $$B(p) = \Omega S^3\langle 3\rangle$$; I think this is the
same fiber sequence as we wrote down a few paragraphs ago).

Their question was answered in the positive by Anick; see
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3205.pdf). In the linked paper, Theriault
shows that there is a space $$T^{2k+1}(p)$$ and a fiber sequence $$\Omega^2
S^{2k+1} \to S^{2k-1} \to T^{2k+1}(p)$$, where the first map induces
multiplication by $$p$$ on $$(2k-1)$$st homotopy groups. (For instance, the
result of Toda's cited above says that $$T^{2p+1}(p) = \Omega S^3\langle
3\rangle$$, as we'd already observed.) Great; this means that we're looking for
a map $$\lambda: Z = \Omega T^{2p^n+1}(p) \to B\GL_1(T(n-1))$$ whose Thom
spectrum is $$\BP{n-1}$$.

I don't know how to do this, but let's grant ourselves some daydreaming time.
Suppose that $$T(n-1)$$ was actually an $$\E_2$$-ring, so to define
$$\lambda$$, it suffices to define a map $$T^{2p^n+1}(p) \to
B^2\GL_1(T(n-1))$$. In [this
paper](http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2001-353-03/S0002-9947-00-02623-4/S0002-9947-00-02623-4.pdf)
(where $$T^{2n-1}(p)$$ is written for what is denoted as $$T^{2n+1}(p)$$ in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3205.pdf), the latter's convention of
which we are adopting), Theriault shows that if $$X$$ is a homotopy commutative
and homotopy associative H-space, then any map $$P^{2k}(p) \to X$$ (where
$$P^{2k}(p)$$ denotes the mod $$p$$ Moore space with top cell in dimension
$$2k$$, i.e., $$\Sigma^\infty P^{2k}(p) = \Sigma^{2k-1} \S/p$$) extends
uniquely (up to homotopy) to a H-space map $$T^{2k+1}(p) \to X$$. If we *also*
assume that $$B^2 \GL_1(T(n-1))$$ is a homotopy commutative and homotopy
associative H-space, then we're reduced to defining a map $$P^{2p^n}(p) \to
B^2\GL_1(T(n-1))$$. This in turn amounts to defining a map $$S^{2p^n-1} \to
B^2\GL_1(T(n-1))$$, i.e., an element $$\omega\in \pi_{2p^n-3}(T(n-1))$$ such
that $$p$$ kills this element.

(**Update:** According to the introduction
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3733v4), Theriault's result is apparently
incorrect. Theorem B in Gray's paper doesn't work here, because $$\pi_\ast
B^2\GL_1(T(n-1))$$ is not $$p$$-power torsion. I don't know how to fix the
suggested argument above. Let's continue as though Theriault's result is in
fact correct.)

Now, I think it is true (proof: hearsay) that $$\pi_{2p^n-3}(T(n-1))$$ is in
fact isomorphic to $$\Z/p$$; since we already know that Beardsley's element
$$\sigma_{n-1}$$ lives in this degree, we find that $$\omega$$ is killed by
$$p$$, and that choosing $$\omega = \sigma_{n-1}$$ defines the desired map
$$P^{2p^n}(p) \to B^2\GL_1(T(n-1))$$. If $$\lambda: Z = \Omega T^{2p^n+1}(p)
\to B\GL_1(T(n-1))$$ denotes the induced map, then there's a map from this Thom
spectrum to $$\BP{n-1}$$ (basically since $$\omega = \sigma_{n-1}$$ is null in
$$\BP{n-1}$$), and I suspect that this is an isomorphism on mod
$$p$$ homology, which implies by Whitehead that $$\BP{n-1}^\wedge_p$$ is in
fact the $$p$$-completion of the Thom spectrum of $$\lambda$$. To say this
properly, we need to understand the homology of $$\Omega T^{2p^n+1}(p)$$.
(Recall that $$\H_\ast \BP{n-1} \cong \FF_p[\ol{\xi}_1, \ol{\xi}_2, \cdots]
\otimes E(\ol{\tau}_n, \ol{\tau}_{n+1}, \cdots)$$ where $$|\ol{\tau}_n| =
2p^n-1$$, and that $$\H_\ast T(n) \cong \FF_p[\ol{\xi}_1, \ol{\xi}_2,
\cdots, \ol{\xi}_n]$$. A Serre spectral sequence calculation shows that
$$\H_\ast T^{2p^n-1}(p) \cong \FF_p[y_{2p^n}^p, x_{2p^n-1}]/x_{2p^n-1}^2$$,
which implies after a small amount of calculation that the homology of $$\Omega
T^{2p^n+1}(p)$$ indeed does the trick.)

Things seem to work out --- modulo a few glaring issues: in the previous
paragraph, we assumed that $$T(n)$$ was an $$\E_2$$-ring, and that $$B^2
\GL_1(T(n))$$ is a homotopy commutative and homotopy associative H-space (as
well as Theriault's apparently false result). (Note that if I asked for $$B^2
\GL_1(T(n))$$ to be a *loop* space, I'd be in trouble: $$T(n)$$ is *not* an
$$\E_3$$-ring; see Example 1.4.28
[here](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~tlawson/papers/dyerlashof.pdf). These
conditions are balanced precisely between the realm of being tantalizingly
close to being true and impossibility.) I don't know if these statements are
true, but it's good to know that the question we raised is related to possibly
attack-able problems in the theory of structured ring spectra. How plausible
are these statements? I don't know how to address the question about $$B^2
\GL_1(T(n))$$, so let's look at the question about $$T(n)$$ being an
$$\E_2$$-ring. Since $$T(n)$$ is a summand of $$X(p^n)$$ given by the Quillen
idempotent, it suffices to show that the Quillen idempotent is an $$\E_2$$-ring
map on $$X(p^n)$$. I don't know how to show this, but see, e.g., Section 6
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03343.pdf), which briefly discusses this
question. (Another, perhaps more minor, issue is that there's a choice of
extension of the map $$S^{2p^n-1} \to B^2\GL_1(T(n-1))$$ to $$P^{2p^n}(p)$$,
and we haven't addressed this.)
