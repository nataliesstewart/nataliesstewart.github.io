We would like to construct an $$\Eoo$$ form of $$\BP{2}$$, in the sense of
[Lawson-Naumann](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.3897.pdf). At the prime $$2$$, this
is given by $$\tmf_1(3)$$, and at the prime $$3$$, there is a
[construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2603) using the full Atkin-Lehner
quotient of the Shimura curve of discriminant $$14$$. In this post, we
discuss some desiderata of an algebro-geometric construction of $$\BP{2}$$.

Fix a prime $$p$$ and $$n$$; then, define $$d(n) =
2\frac{p^{n+1}-1}{p-1}-(n+3)$$.  Then, there is a gap in the homotopy of
$$\pi_\ast L_{K(1)\vee \cdots K(n)} \BP{n}$$: we have $$\pi_t L_{K(1)\vee
\cdots K(n)} \BP{n} = 0$$ for $$-d(n)+1\leq t\leq -1$$. Moreover, there is an
element (the dualizing class, which comes from Anderson duality) in degree
$$\pi_{-d(n)} L_{K(1)\vee \cdots K(n)} \BP{n}$$, such that there is a perfect
pairing

$$\pi_{i-d(n)} L_{K(1)\vee \cdots K(n)} \BP{n}\otimes \pi_{-i} L_{K(1)\vee
\cdots K(n)} \BP{n} \to \pi_{-d(n)} L_{K(1)\vee \cdots K(n)} \BP{n}. \qquad
(\ast)$$

In the case of $$p=n=2$$, we know that $$L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2} \simeq
\Tmf_1(3)$$, and $$d(2) = 9$$; then, the dualizing element is described in
[this
document](https://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/otherpapers/hill-meier2.pdf).

We would like to construct an even-periodic refinement $$\dX$$ of a flat map
$$X\to \Mfg$$ from a *proper* (so that, with a few additional assumptions, has
a dualizing element) Noetherian Deligne-Mumford stack such that $$\Gamma(\dX,
\co_\dX) \simeq L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2}$$. In all known cases where such a
model of $$L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2}$$ is known (i.e., at $$p=2,3$$), the
descent spectral sequence collapses at the $$E_2$$-page: in other words,

$$\pi_\ast L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2} \cong \H^0(X; \omega^{\otimes \ast}) \oplus
\H^1(X; \omega^{\otimes \ast}), \qquad (\ast\ast)$$

and by duality (discussed above) we have $$\H^1(X; \omega^{\otimes \ast}) \cong
\Sigma^{-d(n)} \H^0(X; \omega^{\otimes \ast})^\vee$$. In particular:

* we need there to be an isomorphism $$\H^0(X; \omega^{\otimes \ast}) \cong
  \pi_\ast \BP{2}$$; and
* by Serre duality, it is most natural to ask for $$X$$ to be a smooth and
  proper (stacky) *curve*. Since $$X$$ would have cohomological dimension
one, this implies that the descent spectral sequence degenerates at the
$$E_2$$-page, which explains Equation $$(\ast\ast)$$.

If we assume that $$X$$ is a smooth and proper curve, then we claim that
$$\omega$$ is a dualizing sheaf on $$X$$ if it is ample. To show this, we argue
as in [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06709.pdf#page=28&zoom=100,0,200).
Indeed, since $$L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2}$$ satisfies Anderson duality, we have
$$I_\Z L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2} \simeq \Sigma^{d(2)} L_{K(1)\vee K(2)}
\BP{2}$$, which implies that $$I_\QQ L_\QQ L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2} \simeq
\Sigma^{d(2)} L_\QQ L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2}$$. Since $$d(n)\equiv
-(n+1)\pmod{p}$$, we know that $$d(2)$$ is always odd; let us write $$d(2) =
2k+1$$.  Then, there are isomorphisms

$$\pi_{-d(2)} L_\QQ L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2} \cong \pi_0 I_\QQ L_\QQ
L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2} \cong \Hom_\QQ(\pi_0 L_\QQ L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2},
\QQ) \cong \QQ,$$

so we can choose the element $$D\in \pi_{-d(2)} L_\QQ L_{K(1)\vee K(2)} \BP{2}
\cong \H^1(X; \omega^{\otimes -(d(2)-1)/2})$$ corresponding to $$1\in \QQ$$.
Then, the pairing in Equation $$(\ast)$$ shows that there is a perfect pairing

$$\H^0(X_\QQ; \omega^{\otimes -i-(d(2)-1)/2}) \otimes \H^1(X_\QQ;
\omega^{\otimes i}) \to \H^1(X; \omega^{\otimes -(d(2)-1)/2}) \cong \QQ.$$

If $$\omega$$ is ample, then we find that $$\omega^{\otimes -(d(2)-1)/2}$$ is a
dualizing sheaf on $$X_\QQ$$; in particular, it is isomorphic to the standard
dualizing sheaf $$\Omega^1_{X_\QQ}$$. We need to show that this implies that
$$\omega^{\otimes -(d(2)-1)/2}$$ is a dualizing sheaf on $$X$$; for this, it
suffices to show that the map $$\pic(X) \to \pic(X_\QQ)$$ is injective. This
is a consequence of Proposition II.6.5 of Hartshorne.

In light of the above discussion, we now assume that $$X$$ is a smooth and
proper curve such that $$\omega$$ is ample, so that $$\omega^{\otimes
-(d(2)-1)/2}$$ is the dualizing sheaf of $$X$$. Then $$X$$ has Kodaira
dimension $$-\infty$$; equivalently, $$X$$ must be of genus zero. Since
$$\H^0(X;\omega^{\otimes \ast}) \cong \Z_p[v_1,v_2]$$, we find that $$\proj
\H^0(X;\omega^{\otimes \ast}) \cong \PP^1_{\Z_p}$$. If we assume that $$X$$ is
of genus zero, then $$X$$ is isomorphic to a weighted projective stack
$$\PP(p-1,p^2-1)$$. Since the Picard group of $$\PP(p-1,p^2-1)$$ is isomorphic
to $$\Z$$, and the dualizing sheaf of $$\PP(p-1,p^2-1)$$ is $$\co(2-p-p^2)$$,
it follows that $$\omega^{\otimes -(d(2)-1)/2} \cong \co(2-p-p^2)$$; in
particular, because $$d(2)-1>0$$ for every prime $$p$$, we conclude that
$$\omega$$ is isomorphic to $$\co(1)$$, since $$\frac{2(p^2+p-2)}{d(2)-1} =
1$$. Ampleness is immediate.

There are a few natural candidates of genus zero curves which carry a formal
group: these are modular curves and (quotients of) Shimura curves. For a
general modular curve, there is an open subvariety $$M_{\Gamma_1(N)}$$ of
$$\ol{M}_{\Gamma_1(N)}$$ containing the supersingular points which carries a
$$p$$-divisible group of height $$2$$ such that the associated map
$$M_{\Gamma_1(N)} \to M_p(2)$$ is formally etale. We conclude that $$\Ltwo
\Tmf_{\Gamma_1(N)}$$ is isomorphic to the product of $$E_2^{h\Aut(x)}$$, as
$$x$$ ranges over the $$\ol{\FF_p}$$-isomorphism classes of supersingular
points of $$M_{\Gamma_1(N)}$$.  Since $$\Ltwo \BP{2} \cong
E_2^{h\Gal(\FF_{p^2}/\FF_p)}$$, we need there to be only one such supersingular
point. This leads to the following list of natural desiderata to impose on
$$X$$:

1. $$X$$ is a smooth and proper stacky curve of genus zero (recall that the
   genus zero requirement is equivalent to $$\omega$$ being ample, as proved
above.); and
2. there is only one $$\ol{\FF_p}$$-isomorphism class of points on $$X$$ such
   that the associated $$1$$-dimensional formal group is of height $$2$$.

The genus zero requirement already tells us that it is futile to use modular
curves or (quotients of) Shimura curves to prove the existence of an
$$\Eoo$$-form of $$\BP{2}$$ at all primes: there are only finitely many such
curves of genus zero (for instance, the modular curve $$\ol{M}_{\Gamma_1(N)}$$
is of genus zero if $$1\leq N\leq 10$$ and $$N=12$$). In the case of modular
curves, the restriction on the height of the formal group simply says that
there needs to be only one $$\ol{\FF_p}$$-isomorphism class of supersingular
elliptic curves. In the case of Shimura curves parametrizing abelian surfaces
$$A$$ along with a nondegenerate action $$\Lambda \to \End(A)$$ as described
above, this condition states that there needs to be only one
$$\ol{\FF_p}$$-isomorphism class of such pairs for which $$A[p^\infty]$$ splits
as the sum of a multiplicative and etale $$p$$-divisible group, i.e.,
$$A[p^\infty]$$, and hence $$A$$, is *ordinary*.  (This is a
rather strange requirement to impose, because the locus of ordinary abelian
varieties is dense and open; however, we are saved since we also allow for
*quotients of* Shimura curves. For instance, if we quotient out by the
group $$G$$ of the Atkin-Lehner involutions, then the requirement then states
that the locus of ordinary abelian surfaces is contained inside a single
$$G$$-orbit. Nonetheless, this condition forces the resulting curve to be
rather "small".)

In fact, by work of
[Lawson-Naumann](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.3897.pdf#page=44&zoom=100,0,214),
only one additional condition (descending along the canonical subgroup) is
needed to guarantee that the connective cover of the global sections of an
even-periodic refinement of $$X$$ satisfying the conditions listed above is an
$$\Eoo$$-form of $$\BP{2}$$. It'd be very nice to know of examples where this
is true.
