### Part two: $$\lambda$$/Hodge theory

Let us focus on Kontsevich's fact that the Hochschild cochains are formal,
rather than the fact that the $$\E_2$$-operad is formal. There is a version of
Kontsevich's result in complex geometry, and it is due to
Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov: if $$X$$ is a Calabi-Yau variety, then the Hochschild
cochains on $$X$$, equipped with the (shifted) Lie bracket structure, is
(quasi-isomorphic to) a formal abelian dg-Lie algebra.  (This is usually stated
in more classical language as the fact that deformations of Calabi-Yaus are
unobstructed and smooth, even though the deformation groups are nonzero. This
can be viewed as the complex analytic version of Kontsevich's statement, because
the condition of orientability (i.e., having a nowhere vanishing $$n$$-form) is
replaced with being Calabi-Yau (i.e., having a nowhere vanishing holomorphic
$$n$$-form).) I wrote up some notes about this
[here](https://sanathdevalapurkar.github.io/files/btt.pdf). I'm going to focus
on the BTT theorem rather than Kontsevich's theorem (because it's conceptually
easier for me), but ultimately we're just going to be talking about formality.
One nice thing about BTT which I like is that working in the complex analytic
world gives us a bit more structure, and makes some formulae more transparent.

I will state an abstract version of the BTT theorem (in terms of dg-Lie
algebras); specializing to the Kodaira-Spencer dg-Lie algebra
$$\mathfrak{ks}(X)_q^\bullet = \H^0(X;\Omega^{0,q}\left(\bigwedge^\bullet
T_X\right))$$ with the Lie bracket of vector fields and differential given by
$$\ol{\partial}$$ will give the BTT theorem. (Note the distinction from the
smooth case, where the differential was just zero.) The additional structure of
a volume form $$\omega$$ on the Calabi-Yau variety gives a degree $$-1$$
operator $$\Delta$$, by contracting with $$\omega$$, applying $$\partial$$, and
contracting with (the dual of) $$\omega$$. This makes the Kodaira-Spencer dg-Lie
algebra into a dg-BV-algebra: the bracket is actually given by the Gerstenhaber
bracket

$$[f,g] = (-1)^{|f|} \Delta(fg) - (-1)^{|f|} \Delta(f) g - f\Delta(g);$$

this statement is called the Tian-Todorov lemma, and is the key complex analytic
input into the BTT theorem.

Let $$\fr{g}$$ be a dg-BV-algebra, with BV-operator $$\Delta$$ (of degree
$$-1$$). The above equation for the bracket makes $$\fr{g}$$ into a dg-Lie
algebra, and we can then "quantize" $$\fr{g}$$ in the land of dg-Lie algebras:
if $$\hbar$$ is an element of degree $$2$$, then we get a new dg-Lie algebra
$$\fr{g}[\![\hbar]\!]$$ (which I denoted by $$\fr{g}[\![\beta]\!]$$ in my notes
[here](https://sanathdevalapurkar.github.io/files/btt.pdf), for the same reason
that I'm writing this post), where the Lie bracket is just induced from
$$\fr{g}$$, and where the differential is $$d+\hbar\Delta$$. (Haven't we seen
this before somewhere? Hmm...) Also, I didn't know about this paper when writing
my notes on BTT, but see also [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1290). There is
a $$\hbar$$-adic spectral sequence

$$E_1^{\ast,\ast} = \H^\ast(\fr{g},d)[\![\hbar]\!] \Rightarrow
\H^\ast(\fr{g}[\![\hbar]\!], d+\hbar\Delta).$$

Then, the modern rephrasing of the BTT theorem states: $$\fr{g}[\![\hbar]\!]$$
is quasi-isomorphic to a formal dg-Lie algebra with trivial Lie bracket if and
only if the $$\hbar$$-adic spectral sequence degenerates at $$E_1$$. (Haven't we
also seen this before somewhere? Hmm...)

For example, if $$\Delta$$ and $$d$$ satisfy the analogue of the
$$\partial$$-$$\ol{\partial}$$-lemma (see Theorem 2.3.4 in my
[notes](https://sanathdevalapurkar.github.io/files/btt.pdf)), then it's very
easy to argue this result directly. Because it's cute, I want to recall a proof
(Proposition 4.1.9 in my notes) that if the $$\hbar$$-adic spectral sequence
degenerates at $$E_1$$, then $$\fr{g}[\![\hbar]\!]$$ is (quasi-isomorphic to)
abelian. First, it is fairly easy to directly argue that degeneration implies
that $$\fr{g}$$ is formal. So to show abelianness, we can invert $$\hbar$$.
Define a map $$f$$ on the degree $$1$$ elements in $$\fr{g}[\![\hbar]\!]$$ by

$$f(x) = (d+\hbar\Delta) x + \frac{1}{2}[x,x].$$

It suffices to show that there is some automorphism of $$\fr{g}[\![\hbar]\!]$$
(i.e., coordinate reindexing/change of basis) such that $$f(x) = (d+\hbar\Delta)
x$$. The idea is to look at

$$\phi(x) = \hbar(e^{x/\hbar}-1).$$

Then, one can just calculate:

$$f(\phi(x)) = f(x) e^{x/\hbar} = \hbar((d+\hbar\Delta)(x\hbar^{-1}) +
\hbar[x\hbar^{-1}, x\hbar^{-1}]) e^{x/\hbar} = \hbar \Delta(\phi(x)).$$

(It's strange that $$\phi$$ is essentially the inverse of the Bernoulli series.)

I'd like to move on to other things in a moment, but I want to just pause and
summarize the story so far. Quantization in physics is, from the Heisenberg
point of view, a deformation of classical mechanics, and Kontsevich proved that
such quantizations always exist for smooth (closed, oriented) manifolds with a
given Poisson structure. This has an algebraic/complex analytic analogue, given
by the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem. Both the BTT theorem and Kontsevich's
theorem are given by the formality (and abelianness) of Hochschild homology,
which we have seen is essentially the same as the degeneration of the
$$\hbar$$-adic spectral sequence.

We will now pick up from the degneration of the $$\hbar$$-adic spectral
sequence, and our formula $$d+\hbar\Delta$$ for the differential on
$$\fr{g}[\![\hbar]\!]$$. Let's first focus on the differential. Recall that a
mixed complex is a dg-module over $$C_\ast(S^1)$$. Recall that we're in
characteristic zero, so $$C_\ast(S^1) \simeq \H_\ast(S^1) \cong
k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2$$. Therefore, a mixed complex is just a chain complex
$$(V_\bullet, d)$$ with a square-zero map $$\epsilon$$ of degree $$-1$$. (I
cannot believe that I'm using *co*homological grading.) The homotopy fixed
points of this $$S^1$$-action is a chain complex, given by $$V^{hS^1} =
\Map_{C_\ast(S^1)}(k, V)$$. We can write down a resolution of $$k$$ as a
$$C_\ast(S^1)$$-module, and we find that $$V^{hS^1}$$ is equivalent to the
complex $$(V[\![u]\!], d+u\epsilon)$$, where $$u$$ is the degree $$2$$ element
in

$$k^{hS^1} = \Map_{C_\ast(S^1)}(k, k) = \Map_{k[\epsilon]/\epsilon^2}(k, k).$$

But $$S^1$$ necessarily acts trivially, so $$u$$ is just the Bott class in
$$k^{hS^1} = C^\ast(\CP^\infty;k)$$.

It might be better to denote $$\epsilon$$ by $$\Delta$$, because this obviously
looks a whole lot like the differential on $$\fr{g}[\![\hbar]\!]$$. We also see
the first part of our equation ($$u = \hbar$$) in action. What does the
degeneration of the $$\hbar$$-adic spectral sequence then translate to? It is
easy to see that the $$\hbar$$-adic spectral sequence is exactly the homotopy
fixed points spectral sequence 

$$E_2^{\ast,\ast} = \H^\ast(\CP^\infty; \H^\ast(V)) \cong \H^\ast(V)[\![u]\!]
\Rightarrow \H^\ast(V^{hS^1}),$$

and the degeneration of the $$\hbar$$-adic spectral sequence at the $$E_1$$-page
is just the degeneration of the homotopy fixed points spectral sequence (HFPSS)
at the $$E_2$$-page. (One might be a little worried by the fact that we went
from an $$E_1$$-page to an $$E_2$$-page, but this makes no real difference.)

Before proceeding, I would like to make an observation. The BV-operator
$$\Delta$$ has now appeared in a two different forms. In the deformation
quantization story, it came from the (framed) $$\E_2$$-algebra structure on
Hochschild cohomology, while in the picture we're describing right now, it comes
from an $$S^1$$-action. We'll discuss the link in the next post.

Returning to our main story: one of the most important algebraic examples of a
mixed complex is Hochschild homology: if $$X$$ is a smooth variety, then
$$\HH(X/k)$$ is a mixed complex with the usual $$S^1$$-action. In this case,
what does degeneration of the HFPSS mean? For this, we turn to our trusty tool,
the HKR theorem. We know that $$\HH(X/k)^{hS^1} = \HC^-(X/k)$$ has a filtration
obtained from the HKR filtration such that the $$n$$th graded piece is
$$\Gamma(X; \Omega^{\geq n}_X) u^n$$. It's easier to work with the Tate spectral
sequence, going from $$\hat{\H}^\ast(\CP^\infty; \pi_\ast \HH(X/k))$$ to the
homotopy of $$\HH(X/k)^{tS^1} = \HP(X/k)$$; this degenerates iff the HFPSS
degenerates, so we might as well look at the degeneration of the Tate spectral
sequence. The HKR filtration extends to a filtration on $$\HP(X/k)$$ whose
$$n$$th associated graded is $$\Gamma(X; \Omega_X^\bullet) u^n$$ The Tate SS
going from $$\HH(X/k)$$ to $$\HP(X/k)$$ is a 2-periodic version of the Hodge-de
Rham spectral sequence, and its degeneration can be viewed as a 2-periodic
version of the rational degeneration of the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence.

This connection can be made precise. There is a square of spectral sequences,
which stick together the four spectral sequences

$$\text{HKR: } \H^\ast(X;\Omega^\ast_X) \Rightarrow \pi_\ast \HH(X/k), \\
\text{Hodge-de Rham: } \H^\ast(X;\Omega^\ast_X) \Rightarrow \H^\ast_\dR(X/k), \\
\text{Tate SS: } \hat{\H}^\ast(\CP^\infty; \pi_\ast \HH(X/k)) \Rightarrow
\pi_\ast \HP(X/k), \\
\text{de Rham-HP: } \H^\ast_\dR(X/k) \Rightarrow \pi_\ast \HP(X/k).$$

If the HKR spectral sequence degenerates, then the Tate spectral sequence
degenerating implies that the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence degenerates. The
HKR spectral sequence in turn degenerates if and only if Hochschild homology is
formal as a dg-algebra (which says nothing about the formality as a dg-Lie
algebra, which we saw was Kontsevich's main result). In fact, Hochschild,
Kostant and Rosenberg basically showed that the HKR spectral sequence does
degenerate for smooth proper $$X$$ in characteristic zero, so Tate degeneration
is the same as Hodge-de Rham degeneration.

Before proceeding, let's again stop to recap. So far, we have seen that
$$\hbar$$ behaves exactly like the Bott element $$u$$, and in a sense is nothing
but the Bott element. Moreover, when applied to Hochschild homology and friends,
this perspective tells us that $$\hbar$$-adic degeneration (which obstructs the
existence of a deformation quantization of a Calabi-Yau variety) is exactly
degeneration of the Tate spectral sequence, which in turn is exactly
degeneration of the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence.

The degeneration of the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence is the starting point
for Hodge theory. I'll refer the reader to my notes
[here](https://sanathdevalapurkar.github.io/files/nah.pdf) (see also
[here](https://sanathdevalapurkar.github.io/files/slides-nah.pdf)). The
degeneration of the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence can be categorified into the
nonabelian Hodge correspondence. The de Rham side gets categorified into a
certain subcategory of vector bundles with flat connection (namely, the
semisimple bundles), and the Hodge side gets categorified into a certain
subcategory of Higgs bundles (namely, the ones which are direct sums of Higgs
bundles with the same slope, and which have vanishing first and second Chern
classes).

The intermediary between these two categories is the world of (polystable)
bundles with flat $$\lambda$$-connection. (Again, see my notes.) It is useful to
think of a $$\lambda$$-connection on a vector bundle as a filtration on this
bundle and a connection which satisfies Griffiths transversality with respect to
this filtration. See [this post](/blog/algebraic-geometry/2020/03/19/dmod.html)
for a discussion. Vector bundles with flat connection can be viewed as
($$\co_X$$-coherent) $$\cd_X$$-modules, Higgs bundles as
$$\Sym_X(T_X)$$-modules, and vector bundles with flat $$\lambda$$-connection as
$$\cd_X^\lambda$$-modules, where $$\cd_X^\lambda = \bigoplus_{i\geq 0}
\cd_X^{\leq i} \lambda^i$$ is the Rees construction on the order filtration on
$$\cd_X$$, and $$\lambda$$ is our Rees construction variable.

From this point of view, we can look at the de Rham complex $$\Omega_X^\bullet$$
(which is a resolution of $$(\co_X, d)$$ as a D-module) equipped with the Hodge
filtration/the stupid filtration. This makes it a $$\co_X$$ module with a flat
$$\lambda$$-connection, where again we view $$\lambda$$-connections as
filtrations + connection satisfying Griffiths transversality. Then, the Hodge-de
Rham spectral sequence is nothing but the $$\lambda$$-adic spectral sequence. 

Therefore, $$\lambda$$ is nothing but $$\hbar$$ (which we saw earlier is just
the Bott element $$u$$). To fix the resulting weird grading in the statement of
the nonabelian Hodge correspondence (where $$\lambda$$ lives in degree $$2$$),
we refer the reader to [this
post](/blog/algebraic-topology/2020/07/18/nah-redux.html). For now, we can just
think of this as a sort of "shearing"; but as we shall see, this is too naive of
a perspective to be taking in characteristic $$p$$/over the sphere spectrum. (So
the title of this post is a bit misleading...) We'll talk about this next time.
