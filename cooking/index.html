<h1>Repository of poorly formatting info on veg cooking</h1>

This page is under construction.
Eventually I will have a full list here of recipes that I like, with modifications made as necessary.

I promise I don't solely cook asian food, I just <i>mostly</i> cook asian food.

<ul>
  <li>
    Korean recipes.
    I tend to look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyn-K7rZLXjGl7VXGweIlcA">Paik's Cuisine</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Maangchi">Maangchi</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SeonkyoungLongest">Seonkyoung Longest</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-SmuIHMG2HPDFUOBRu5LnA">Future Neighbor</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/">Korean Bapsang</a> for these.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Kimchi:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/easy-kimchi">Napa cabbage kimchi.</a>
            Replace fish sauce with a mixture of soy sauce and vegan oyster sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/kkakdugi">Kkakdugi.</a>
            Same substitution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://seonkyounglongest.com/dongchimi-korean-water-kimchi/">Dongchimi.</a>
            No substitution necessary!
            It works fine without the pear extract. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Stew (jjigae).
        In all of the following, replace anchovy stock with kelp and/or shitaake stock/dashi/yuksu.
        Eventually I'll list meat subs as well.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Deonjang jjigae 
          </li>
          <li>
            Cheonggukjang jjigae
          </li>
          <li>
            Kimchi sundubu jjigae 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pancakes (jeon).
        Most of these are vegan by default (especially if you use homemade veg kimchi), and need no modification.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Garlic chive jeon
          </li>
          <li>
            Potato jeon
          </li>
          <li>
            Kimchi jeon
          </li>
          <li>
            Scallion jeon
          </li>
          <li>
            Vegetable jeon
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Misc banchan.
        Most of these will be vegetarian by default.
        I won't list * namul, since those are simple enough as-is.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/geomeun-kongjorim">Braised black beans.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/dubu-jorim">Gochujang braised tofu.</a>
            Do almost identical things with potato, tempeh, etc. for variety.
          </li>
          <li>
            Danmuji:
            don't waste your time making it, just buy it if you have a korean market nearby.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://futuredish.com/korean-smashed-tofu-banchan-scoop-it-over-rice/">Spicy tofu crumble.</a>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Misc mains.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tteokboki.
          </li>
          <li>
            Veggie dumplings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Veggie japchae.
          </li>
          <li>
            Veggie kimbap.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/street-toast">Korean street toast</a>.
            Mustard is necessary.
            In America, the bread is already too sweet, so skip the sugar.
            For a nice nutty edge, add some sesame oil to the mix.
            A few slices of American "cheese" can be nice, as can some raw shredded cabbage on top.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://seonkyounglongest.com/vegan-jjajangmyeon/">Jjajang</a>.
            Serve over rice as jjajangbap or over fresh noodles as jjajangmyeon. 
            It's very heavy and savory, so pair with radish (danmuji & kkakdugi both work well), maybe some bean sprouts namul, and definitely a sunny-side-up egg if served over rice.
            Potato can be nice as part of the veggies;
            you'll never see the difference.

    Indian recipes.
    These are a goldmine for vegetarian & vegan recipes without alteration.

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Chinese recipes.
    Most of these are heavily altered away from meat dishes, and I tend to go for either Sichuan dishes or americanized takeout-style dishes.
