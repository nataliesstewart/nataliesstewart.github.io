<h1>Repository of poorly formatting info on veg cooking</h1>

This page is under construction.
Eventually I will have a full list here of recipes that I like, with modifications made as necessary.

I promise I don't solely cook asian food, I just <i>mostly</i> cook asian food.
For personal use, I also keep a <a href="https://nataliesstewart.github.io/backlog">backlog of recipes that I want to try.</a>


<ul>
  <li>
    Korean recipes.
    I tend to look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyn-K7rZLXjGl7VXGweIlcA">Paik's Cuisine</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Maangchi">Maangchi</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SeonkyoungLongest">Seonkyoung Longest</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-SmuIHMG2HPDFUOBRu5LnA">Future Neighbor</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/">Korean Bapsang</a> for these.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Kimchi:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/easy-kimchi">Napa cabbage kimchi.</a>
            Replace fish sauce with a mixture of soy sauce and vegan oyster sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/kkakdugi">Kkakdugi.</a>
            Same substitution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://seonkyounglongest.com/dongchimi-korean-water-kimchi/">Dongchimi.</a>
            No substitution necessary!
            It works fine without the pear extract. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Stew (jjigae).
        In all of the following, replace anchovy stock with kelp and/or shitaake stock/dashi/yuksu.
        Eventually I'll list meat subs as well.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Deonjang jjigae 
          </li>
          <li>
            Cheonggukjang jjigae
          </li>
          <li>
            Kimchi sundubu jjigae 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pancakes (jeon).
        Most of these are vegan by default (especially if you use homemade veg kimchi), and need no modification.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Garlic chive jeon
          </li>
          <li>
            Potato jeon
          </li>
          <li>
            Kimchi jeon
          </li>
          <li>
            Scallion jeon
          </li>
          <li>
            Vegetable jeon
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Misc banchan.
        Most of these will be vegetarian by default.
        I won't list * namul, since those are simple enough as-is.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/geomeun-kongjorim">Braised black beans.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/dubu-jorim">Gochujang braised tofu.</a>
            Do almost identical things with potato, tempeh, etc. for variety.
          </li>
          <li>
            Danmuji:
            don't waste your time making it, just buy it if you have a korean market nearby.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://futuredish.com/korean-smashed-tofu-banchan-scoop-it-over-rice/">Spicy tofu crumble.</a>
            Consider replacing the tofu with TVP if you want to trade off fat for more protein.
	  </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://futuredish.com/korean-pickles-jar-make-jangajji/">Various pickles</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Misc mains.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/tteokbokki">Tteokboki.</a>
            Skip the fish cakes/balls, replace anchovy kelp stock with shitaake kelp stock, and add soy sauce and/or veg oyster sauce to help out the flavor.
            Consider making it more substantial with some cabbage if you're serving this as a meal.
          
            There are actually many preparations of this, and the above is just for classic soupy tteokboki.
            I'm personally a fan of adding cheese on top of a slightly less soupy tteokboki, or making a jjajang tteokboki (which is jjajang + tteokboki cakes).
          </li>
          <li>
            Veggie dumplings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Veggie japchae.
          </li>
          <li>
            Veggie kimbap.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://seonkyounglongest.com/vegan-korean-bulgogi/">Tofu and mushroom bulgogi</a>.
            Go ahead and n-tuple the recipe.
            I like oyster mushrooms, but any kind of mushrooms will do.
            For extra variety, consider caremalizing some onions and throwing them in with the mushrooms.
            To round out the meal, consider serving w kimchi, rice, and lettuce leaves (or parilla, cabbage, etc) as ssam.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/street-toast">Korean street toast</a>.
            Mustard is necessary.
            In America, the bread is already too sweet, so skip the sugar.
            For a nice nutty edge, add some sesame oil to the mix.
            A few slices of American "cheese" can be nice, as can some raw shredded cabbage on top.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://seonkyounglongest.com/vegan-jjajangmyeon/">Jjajang</a>.
            Serve over rice as jjajangbap or over fresh noodles as jjajangmyeon. 
            It's very heavy and savory, so pair with radish (danmuji & kkakdugi both work well), maybe some bean sprouts namul, and definitely a sunny-side-up egg if served over rice.
            Potato can be nice as part of the veggies;
            you'll never see the difference.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=https://thekoreanvegan.com/spicy-crunchy-garlic-tofu-kkampoong-tofu/">Kkanpong tofu</a>.
            This one is technically a veganized korean-chinese fushion dish.
            The above recipe heavily exaggerates the spiciness.
            As with most korean-chinese fushion, pair with radish.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Indian recipes.
    These are a goldmine for vegetarian & vegan recipes without alteration.
    Alterations will mostly be for localization, so this is mostly just a list of dishes I like.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mains:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Aloo gobi
          </li>
          <li>
            Chana masala
          </li>
          <li>
            Dal makhani
          </li>
          <li>
            Paneer makhani
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/palak-paneer-recipe-easy-paneer-recipes-step-by-step-pics/"> Palak paneer. </a>
            Double the recipe, and be generous with the butter/ghee.
            Tomato puree colors the recipe heavily, so consider using either fresh tomats or a reduced amount of puree.
            I like the smooth curry strat listed here (blending things after softening the onions), and the hot water soak for frozen paneer is good.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXq9IAM-ad0"> Rajma Masala. </a>
            Consider pulling back the chili powder amount a tiny bit.
            The amchur is absolutely delicous and you should use it.
            One time, I blended in zucchini (1 part per par part onion) with the onions and tomatoes and reduced the water amount; 
	    this complicated the taste in a good way, but harmed the texture a bit (it became soupier).
	  </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Chutnies: TODO
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Chinese recipes.
    Most of these are heavily altered away from meat dishes, and I tend to go for either Sichuan dishes or americanized takeout-style dishes.
    For authentic recipes, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54SLBnD5k5U3Q6N__UjbAw">Chinese cooking demystified</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0m_Ah8P_MQbnn77-vYnYw">Chef Wang</a>.
    For simplified, often takout-style, always vegan recipes, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/officialveganrev"> Yeung Man</a> (who also does plenty of non-chinese cooking).
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpnLLhBVIjk"> Mapo tofu</a>.
        Good subs for the mince include plant-based ground, mushrooms, and/or plenty of extra soy sauce & veg oyster sauce in the broth;
        it's there for flavor, so don't bother trying to emulate texture.
        If avoiding dried chilis, use chili powder and/or replace some of the oil with chili oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hot pot.
        This is pretty simple, and the only part that takes some thinking is fillings.
        The following are my favorite that I've had:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fried tofu skins
          </li>
          <li>
            Fried tofu puffs
          </li>
          <li>
            Tofu slices (thin slices of pressed firm tofu)
          </li>
          <li>
            Oyster mushrooms
          </li>
          <li>
            Enoki mushrooms
          </li>
          <li>
            Beech mushrooms
          </li>
          <li>
            Wood ear mushrooms
          </li>
          <li>
            Napa cabbage leaves
          </li>
          <li>
            Shangai tip bok choy
          </li>
          <li>
            Lotus root
          </li>
          <li>
            Noodles (of course).
          </li>
        </ul>
        The broth might need a bit of extra love throughout the meal on account of the lack of meat fat rendering into it.
        You end up eating big portions since none of the ingredients are particularly filling (compared to meat).
      </li>
      <li>
        Kung pao tofu.
        This is straightforward;
        substitute tofu in a kung pao chicken recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        The rest: TODO! 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Misc or fusion dishes.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fried rice:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Classic chinese fried rice.
            Whatever you had in your fridge + some soy sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mala fried rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kimchi veggie fried rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kkakdugi fried rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Omurice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Masala fried rice.
            A few whole spices, ghee, leftover veggies, day old basmati, turmeric, garam masala, lots of chili powder. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Ramen:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Classic miso ramen
          </li>
          <li>
            Faux-sichuan ramen
          </li>
          <li>
            Gochujang ramen
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/85452/homemade-black-bean-veggie-burgers/">Bean burger.</a>
        I use many alterations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            chop the veggies incredibly small, using red bell peppers instead of green.
          </li>
          <li>  
            fry the veggies in olive oil, then blot before adding to the beans
          </li>
          <li>
            skip the hot sauce, replace with a soy and veg oyster sauce mix (by taste)
          </li>
          <li>
            add a small amount of scallion greens for color
          </li>
          <li>
            freeze before grilling, and it'll hold together without needing foil
          </li>
          <li>
            consider either serving with generous amounts of mustard or adding some vinegar; I haven't tried vinegar yet, but a bit of tang goes a long way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        One of the burgers made by this is kind of small.
        If you want to be full, consider eating two.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
