In my view, mathematics is a largely social activity, and one whose history contains countless issues surrounding unequal access and fixation on particular "geniuses." 
I believe the following axioms to be self-evident, and they guide my perspective.

# Federico Ardila's axioms on diversity.

**Axiom 1.** Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

**Axiom 2.** Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

**Axiom 3.** Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

**Axiom 4.** Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
